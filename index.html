                <p>ABSTRACT <br><br>

                    In Nepal, as well as in many other constitutional democracies, there are two types of judicial
                    review' -
                    judicial review of administrative action, and judicial review of legislation. Both types of judicial
                    review' are
                    based on the idea of rule of law. This idea means that not only citizens, but also government
                    officials, are
                    subject to the law. If these officials do something that the law does not allow them to do, the
                    courts are
                    allowed to nullify their actions.<br><br>

                    The first type of judicial review' involves with the actions of the executive branch of government.
                    In the
                    modern state, it is impossible for the legislature to address every administrative decision (such as
                    the
                    decision to issue or to refuse to issue a business license and so on); therefore, many statutes
                    endow various
                    governmental authorities with administrative powers. If a person believes that a certain
                    governmental authority
                    has exercised its power in an arbitrary, discriminatory, or otherwise unreasonable way, he/she can
                    file a
                    petition in a court of law and asking for judicial review', that is, to ask that the court review
                    the
                    administrative decision. If the court finds in favour of the plaintiff, it can annul the
                    administrative
                    decision.<br><br>

                    Judicial review of administration is, in a sense, the heart of administrative law. It is certainly
                    the most
                    appropriate method of inquiring into the legal competence of a public authority. The aspects of an
                    official
                    decision or an administrative act that may be scrutinized by the judicial process are the competence
                    of the
                    public authority, the extent of a public authority's legal powers, the adequacy and fairness of the
                    procedure,
                    the evidence considered in arriving at the administrative decision and the motives underlying it,
                    and the nature
                    and scope of the discretionary power. An administrative act or decision can be invalidated on any of
                    these
                    grounds if the reviewing court or tribunal has a sufficiently wide jurisdiction. There is also the
                    question of
                    responsibility for damage caused by the public authority in the performance of its functions.
                    Judicial review is
                    less effective as a method of inquiring into the wisdom, expediency, or reasonableness of
                    administrative acts,
                    and courts and tribunals are unwilling to substitute their own decisions for that of the responsible
                    authority.<br><br>

                    Judicial review of administration varies internationally. Sweden and France, for instance, have gone
                    as far as
                    subjecting the exercise of all discretionary powers, other than those relating to foreign affairs
                    and defense,
                    to judicial review and potential limitation. Elsewhere, a preoccupation with procedure results in
                    judicial
                    review deciding only whether the correct procedure was observed rather than examining the substance
                    of the
                    decision.<br><br>

                    The other type of judicial review' does not involve the actions of the executive branch, but rather
                    the actions
                    of the legislative branch. Under this the Constitution guarantees the right for individuals to
                    challenge
                    legislation which does not conform to the Constitution thereby giving courts the power to engage in
                    judicial
                    review' on the constitutionality of legislation. The purpose of this type of judicial review', also
                    referred to
                    as "constitutional review", is to ensure that legislation conforms to the Constitution. The
                    Constitution
                    regulates two different areas the division of powers between/among the organs of government, and the
                    rights
                    guaranteed to every citizen against government. Consequently, there are two ways in which an act of
                    a
                    legislature or of Parliament might be unconstitutional. First, when the act so enacted overlaps or
                    contradicts
                    with the Constitution or secondly, when the act violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.against
                    government.
                    Consequently, there are two ways in which an act of a legislature or of Parliament might be
                    unconstitutional.
                    First, when the act so enacted overlaps or contradicts with the Constitution or secondly, when the
                    act violates
                    the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

                    When a court strikes down legislation on overlapping or division of powers grounds, it does not mean
                    that the
                    content of law itself violates the Constitution. Rather, it means that the institution which enacted
                    the law (a
                    provincial legislature or Parliament) violates the Constitution. Consequently, if there is a strong
                    public
                    interest in enacting this legislation, the appropriate institution can enact this act. Conversely,
                    when a court
                    strikes down legislation on Charter grounds, it means that the content of law violates the
                    Constitution, and no
                    legislature could properly enact this law. For this reason, judicial review' on Charter issues is
                    often
                    criticized as illegitimate since it gives to the judiciary the power to block important legislative
                    initiatives.

                    The obvious response to this criticism is that when the courts nullify legislation that violates the
                    Constitution, it enforces this document, not the judicial will. An objection to this response is
                    that the
                    language of the Charter is very open-textured, and refers to abstract concepts such as "freedom of
                    expression".
                    People could reasonably disagree about the meaning of such concepts, and therefore courts would not
                    really
                    enforce "the Charter". Rather, they impose their own subjective reading of the ambiguous language of
                    the
                    Charter. Since judges are not democratically elected, and cannot be replaced in office by the public
                    will, their
                    own view of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms has no legitimacy.<br><br>

                    The question pertaining to the legitimacy of constitutional review is poignant for every
                    constitutional
                    democracy and is not unique to Nepal. It has been the subject of a vast body of literature in the
                    past few
                    years. The two most common responses to this question are: first, precisely because the
                    Constitution's language
                    is ambiguous, it needs interpretation by an authoritative institution. For the reason that part of
                    the purpose
                    of the Charter, indeed of the entire Constitution, is to protect minority groups and individuals, it
                    should not
                    be enforced and interpreted by majoritarian institutions such as the legislature. Judges are not
                    elected and are
                    not accountable, and therefore they are best capable of interpreting the Constitution in a way that
                    will protect
                    minorities.<br><br>

                    Second, while courts have the power to strike down legislation based on their reading of the
                    Constitution, in
                    reality judicial decisions are not final, and legislatures have their ways to respond to a judicial
                    decision
                    with which they do not agree.<br><br>

                    Judicial review refers to the power of courts to determine whether the acts of all branches of
                    government and
                    government officials comply with the Constitution. An American innovation, judicial review is the
                    basic
                    institution by which the Constitution has become the supreme law of the land rather than a hortatory
                    document
                    like the Declaration of Independence.<br><br>

                    Exercised by both the state and federal judiciary, judicial review is most identified with the U.S.
                    Supreme
                    Court. Although the Constitution does not expressly provide for the same, the Founding Fathers
                    anticipated that
                    the Court would exercise some control over the other branches of government. Chief Justice John
                    Marshall's
                    famous assertion of judicial review in Marbury v. Madison (1803) was not a brash departure but a
                    crystallization
                    of a nascent tradition.<br><br>

                    That tradition was an amalgam of three somewhat contradictory strands of the young Republic's
                    political and
                    legal culture; popular sovereignty, fundamental law, and judicial independence. Popular sovereignty
                    meant that
                    the people were the paramount law-giver and that they had ordained a Constitution allowing each
                    branch of
                    government only limited power. Fundamental law meant that there were divinely ordained and
                    traditionally
                    respected moral principles that should remain in force. Judicial independence meant that the Court's
                    view of the
                    Constitution could not be controlled by any other branch of government.<br><br>

                    Some of the Court's specific decisions and doctrines have provoked intense debate, but since
                    Marbury, the
                    propriety of judicial review has rarely been controverted. Instead, arguments have centered on the
                    Court's use
                    of its power. On occasion, the Court's decisions have raised controversies concerning judicial
                    review itself. In
                    the nineteenth century these controversies focused on whether the Court is the Constitution's
                    ultimate
                    expositor; in the twentieth, on how the Court is to interpret the Constitution. These controversies
                    present the
                    enduring problems of "Constitutional" versus "judicial" supremacy, and judicial "restraint" versus
                    "activism."<br><br>

                    "Constitutional supremacy" is the doctrine that the Constitution, not the Court's rulings, is the
                    supreme law of
                    the land, and consequently, that every government official is entitled to act according to his or
                    her
                    understanding of that document. It means that the Court is entitled to abide by its interpretation
                    of the
                    Constitution in cases that come before it, but that the interpretation does not bind any other
                    branch of
                    government. "Judicial supremacy" is the opposite doctrine-that both the letter and spirit of the
                    Court's
                    constitutional determinations bind all branches of government and government officials. The premises
                    that
                    Marshall drew from in establishing judicial review speak ambiguously with regard to judicial
                    supremacy. Indeed,
                    the argument that the Supreme Court is an independent branch of government is reversible: other
                    branches of
                    government are also independent, and the Court cannot dictate its constitutional views to
                    them.<br><br>

                    Accordingly, all that Marbury clearly established was that in cases before it, the Court would abide
                    by its
                    understanding of the Constitution. Furthermore, extremely contentious litigation (Martin v. Hunter's
                    Lessee,
                    1816, and Cohens v. Virginia, 1821) established that the Supreme Court's constitutional
                    determinations bind
                    state courts. Martin and Cohens represented the limits of the Court's acknowledged supremacy in the
                    nineteenth
                    century.<br><br>

                    Throughout the pre-Civil War period, however, state courts took the position that Supreme Court
                    rulings governed
                    only the cases it actually determined, and they felt free to apply different principles to other
                    cases, no
                    matter how closely analogous to Supreme Court precedent. Nor did the other branches of the national
                    government
                    regard themselves as bound by Supreme Court determinations. President Thomas Jefferson advocated
                    this view.
                    President Andrew Jackson acted upon it when he vetoed a bill re-chartering the Bank of America and
                    indicated
                    that he would not enforce the Court's mandate in Worcester v. Georgia (1832). President Abraham
                    Lincoln, too,
                    refused to comply with a variety of Court writs and mandates.<br><br>

                    Yet, in the century following the Civil War, the Court's views on constitutional issues acquired a
                    special
                    status. Public opinion came to associate a stable constitutional order with respect for the Court's
                    determinations. Drawing from this well of public support, the Court, since the mid-twentieth
                    century, has spoken
                    of itself as the ultimate" and "supreme" expositor of the Constitution.<br><br>

                    Nonetheless, the extent to which judicial review means judicial supremacy remains unclear. President
                    Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower federalized the Arkansas National Guard to prevent the state from interfering with
                    federal court
                    orders stemming from Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1952) to desegregate the Little Rock
                    school system.
                    On the national level, recent presidents and Congresses generally have obeyed direct Court
                    orders.<br><br>

                    Yet compliance with specific rulings has not been coupled with respect for the principles the Court
                    adopts in
                    its decisions. Frequently, government officials obey the Court's mandate in a given case, but
                    continue to pursue
                    the policy the Court had declared unconstitutional. At times, state legislatures enact clearly
                    unconstitutional
                    laws when it seems politically beneficial to do so. Thus, though the contemporary Court may be
                    accorded more
                    "supremacy" than its nineteenth-century predecessors, the doctrine of constitutional supremacy
                    remains
                    unresolved.<br><br>

                    "Judicial restraint" and "judicial activism" refer to the extent to which the Court defers to the
                    constitutional
                    determinations of other branches of government and the extent to which it refuses to impose
                    affirmative
                    obligations upon government. Throughout its history, the Court has claimed to exercise judicial
                    review with
                    restraint, but it has always actively pursued its chosen policies of the moment.<br><br>

                    The disparity between the Court's claims and its actions attracted little comment until the 1890s,
                    when James
                    Thayer published an article that moved the issue of judicial restraint to the center of
                    constitutional debate.
                    He argued that the Constitution has a range of possible meanings and that the Court should void only
                    those acts
                    of the national government that are beyond the pale of permissible meaning. Whenever it voids an act
                    that is not
                    clearly mistaken," it is overturning an interpretation that a coequal branch of government prefers
                    and
                    substituting an interpretation it prefers. Non-deferential review, he concluded, is discretionary
                    lawmaking that
                    usurps the executive and legislative functions.<br><br>

                    After Thayer, judicial review began to be conceived as a device by which nine unaccountable
                    officials impose
                    their opinions upon the nation. With the rise of pragmatic jurisprudence and legal realism in the
                    early
                    twentieth century, the view that judges make law when they interpret the Constitution became a
                    truism. And the
                    central issue of judicial review has become what, if anything, justifies their doing so. The Court
                    responded by
                    engaging in restrained or active review according to principles first sketched by Justice Harlan
                    Fiske Stone in
                    United States v. Carolene Products Co. (1938). Those principles spurned active review except when
                    necessary to
                    guard freedoms specifically protected by the Bill of Rights, rights considered fundamental to the
                    functioning of
                    the political process, or the rights of "discrete and insular" minority groups. Under these
                    principles, the
                    Court began in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954) a course of review that changed the face
                    of American
                    society by enforcing the civil rights of minority groups and the poor and enlarging the civil
                    liberties of all
                    citizens. This course frequently required the judiciary to impose remedial measures that redirected
                    the
                    activities of the states.<br><br>

                    These developments provoked controversy, which coalesced around the Court's defense of the
                    un-enumerated right
                    of privacy in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965) and its development into the right to an abortion in
                    Roe v. Wade
                    (1973). Because of the controversy, and eight years of conservative Republican appointments, the
                    Court in the
                    mid-1980s reversed its course and began to abandon the Carolene Products model of judicial review.
                    In its place,
                    the Court has claimed to be developing a model of judicial review premised upon judicial restraint.
                    The new
                    Court has said it will defer to the decisions of democratically accountable officials and overturn
                    only those
                    acts that clearly violate specific Constitutional text or traditions. Yet the Court's protection of
                    property
                    rights in Nollan v. California Coastal Commission (1987) and its condemnation of a municipal
                    affirmative action
                    plan in City of Richmond v. J. A. Cronson Co. (1989) intimated more active review of some
                    Constitutional claims.
                    Thus it is unclear whether the Court's recent rulings portend a triumph of judicial restraint or
                    merely another
                    shift in the focus of judicial activism.<br><br>

                    Judicial review, then, remains firmly established but subject to limitations. The controversies over
                    judicial
                    review may be interminable because, as Robert McCloskey pointed out, they attempt to resolve
                    America's
                    contradictory commitment to popular sovereignty and judicially enforceable fundamental law.<br><br>

                    Broadly speaking judicial review conforms to one of two models, the Austrian and the American. Under
                    the former,
                    questions of the constitutionality of legislation can be decided only by a special Constitutional
                    Court on
                    reference from an authorized person who may or may not be a judge before whom such a question is
                    raised in the
                    course of ordinary litigation, and the review may be a priori or posteriori. Under the latter, it is
                    the duty of
                    any judge before whom such a question is raised in the course of (extra-ordinary) litigation to deal
                    with it
                    there and then, although, no doubt, in important cases the question will finally be decided by the
                    Supreme
                    Court; review of this kind is necessarily a posteriori. The French system can, perhaps, be regarded
                    as a
                    particular version of the Austrian Model, for the Conseil Constitutionnel alone has power to
                    pronounce a
                    parliamentary law unconstitutional and then only on the reference of specified persons; the
                    challenged law is
                    referred to the onseil before promulgation, and no law or part of law declared to be
                    unconstitutional may be
                    promulgated. It is typical of the Austrian Model that the decisions of the Constitutional court have
                    effect erga
                    omnes. Under the American Model, by contrast, the decision, even if of the Supreme Court, is binding
                    as res
                    judicata only between the parties. In countries of the common law tradition this is not a serious
                    disadvantage
                    because the doctrine stare decisis has the result that the decision that a law is unconstitutional
                    will almost
                    invariably be applied thereafter, but elsewhere as, for example, in some countries of Latin-America
                    where the
                    American Model has been followed, such a decision will be disregarded by other courts and the
                    administration
                    alike. On the whole, therefore, the American Model is seen as unsuitable for countries of the civil
                    law
                    tradition.<br><br>

                    Nepal, so far is concerned, adopts something new and hybrid model to that of Austrian and American
                    ones. Though
                    the Nepalese Model of constitutional review is closer to that of American one, there are some new
                    and specific
                    provisions for judicial review in the Constitution that has made Nepal different from America and
                    other country
                    of the world. Article 88 of the 1990 Constitution and Article 107 of the 2007 Interim Constitution
                    of Nepal has
                    vested the exclusive jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to determine all questions relating to the
                    constitutional
                    validity of laws in force in the territory of Nepal, and to issue order for the settlement of any
                    constitutional
                    or legal question involved in any dispute of public interest or concern. <br><br>

                    The Constitution has explicitly mentioned the provision of public interest litigation (PIL), which
                    is very much
                    advanced form of judicial activism and which cannot be found in Indian and American Models. In India
                    and America
                    there is a practice of PIL. but they have. not explicitly mentioned the same in the Constitution.
                    Similarly, the
                    fundamental rights also have been specifically guaranteed in the Constitution. The Constitution has
                    provided
                    unlimited grounds of locus standi. Any Nepalese citizen can file a writ petition in the Supreme
                    Court to declare
                    the legislative acts and administrative actions void to the extent of inconsistency with the
                    Constitution.<br><br>

                    The system of judicial review has been foresightedly in-built in the Nepalese Constitution, in order
                    that the
                    integrity of the Constitution may be preserved against any hasty or ill considered changes, "the
                    fruit of
                    passion or ignorance." The Constitution maker of Nepal very wisely incorporated in the Constitution
                    itself, the
                    system so as to maintain the balance of state organs, to protect fundamental rights guaranteed to
                    the citizens
                    and to afford a useful weapon for equality, liberty and freedom. The system of judicial review in
                    Nepal has not
                    only a legal basis but it has also a philosophical and ethical foundation, and the vitality of this
                    system
                    stands mostly on the historical perspective, social and economic view of life and also on the
                    persuasive
                    conscience of the judiciary.<br><br>

                    The judiciary is the guardian of individual rights in Nepal like in elsewhere. The fundamental
                    difference in
                    approach to the question of individual rights between Nepal and other country, in particular the UK,
                    is that
                    while the UK seems anxious to protect individual rights only from the abuses of executive powers,
                    but the
                    founding fathers of Nepalese Constitution were apprehensive of tyranny not only from the executive
                    but also from
                    the legislature.<br><br>


                <h2>Central Thesis of the Work</h2>
                THE CENTRAL THESIS OF THE WORK

                Constitution, fundamental rights and judicial review are interrelated and interdependent. Constitution
                and
                fundamental rights cannot be divorced from judicial review. Nor can judicial review be divorced from
                fundamental
                rights and Constitution. There will be no Constitution without fundamental rights, no fundamental rights
                without
                judicial review, and no judicial review with out competent, impartial and independent judiciary.<br><br>

                The basic presumption of this thesis is that the fundamental rights vis a vis peoples' sovereignty and
                independent,
                impartial and competent judiciary are the core basis of the structure and functioning of judicial
                review, without
                which the whole system of judicial review becomes futile.<br><br>

                Thus, the central thesis of the work is that there can be no Constitution without fundamental rights, no
                fundamental
                rights without judicial review and none of these without independent, impartial and competent judicial
                system.
                Judicial review is in essence an endeavor to judge positive law and government action in the light of
                ultimate
                values. It is a means by which human aspirations, as expressed in concretized into a living
                Constitution.
                constitutional absolutes, are concretized into a living Constitution. (xvii)<br><br>

                    INTRODUCTION, STRUCTURE AND METHODOLOGY </h2><br><br>

                1.1 General Introduction. <br>

                The doctrine of judicial review occupies a significant place in the formal justice system of modern
                state. The term doctrine used for judicial review has, in the light of its performance of a long course
                of time, been assessed as a system and institution. In this perspective, judicial review is not merely a
                doctrine but it has also become a system and institution. Supremacy of the Constitution and fundamental
                rights are upheld by judicial review, which is conceived as one of the fundamental components of the
                constitutionalism

                        state where the written Constitution is adopted the legislature is empowered to enact the law,
                        the executive to enforce the law and the judiciary to scrutinize the legality and
                        constitutionality of such enacted and enforced law. Of them, the judiciary carries out its
                        function through judicial review, as a judicial instrument and which is supreme power of the
                        judicature in the democratic countries. The judiciary through this power protects the rights of
                        the people and controls the unconstitutional and illegal action of the government, namely, the
                        legislature and the executive. It is, therefore, the power of judicial review vested in the
                        judiciary is accepted and regarded as an integral part of the constitutionalism. </i> (See M. P.

                In fact, there can be no "living" and "genuine" Constitution without judicial review. It is simply
                because that the Constitution outlines the guarantee of fundamental rights and the judicial review
                provides safeguard to such rights so that

                <span id="pageno">pg:1</span> <br>

                they could be enforced and protected from the undue encroachments of the government.

                This system is required in a state, among others, to play the three prominent functions; they include:
                legitimating the government action, protecting the Constitution against any undue encroachment by the
                government, and safeguarding the people from the democratic tyranny. <input type="checkbox"

                In a situation, the system of judicial review is predicated upon the existence of a written Constitution
                and it is changeable only by some extraordinary process of legislation or referendum. On the
                significance of the system, it is said that in a state where the constitutional supremacy prevails the
                Constitution can remain a living moral and intellectual force only by judicial review, and through the
                process of which the court succeeds in moulding the governmental process and regulating the social and
                economic structure of the society. In Nepal, the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990 had ensured
                this system as a basic structure of the Constitution and it is non-amendable unchangeable provision of
                the Constitution. <input type="checkbox" id="fn1.2.5" /><label

                Constitution of Nepal 2007 has also continued the provision through its Article 107. <br><br>

                Judicial review simply is the process whereby the supreme judicial body of the state examines the
                decisions given by their inferior judicial body in order to establish whether or not they are under the
                process of due law. In the context of Constitutional law, the term judicial review is, however, used
                differently. It has a wider as well as a narrower sense of meaning. In a wider sense, it is simply used
                to mean a final consideration and decision by a court of law that may be of dispute between private
                parties or between the private party and the state or a public authority. In a narrower and a technical
                sense, it is used to mean as the Constitutional <a id="pageno">[pg:2]</a> <br>


                provision of the state whereby a court of law examines the Constitutionality of any law made by
                legislature or rules, orders or decisions made by executive or executive departments. <input

                    ACTS, Preface to the First Edition, N. M. Tripathi Pvt. Ltd., (1974). <br><br></span> In this
                regard, the system of judicial review can be categorized into two types, namely, the judicial review of
                administrative action, and the judicial review of legislative acts. <br><br>

                Judicial review of administration is, in a sense, the heart of administrative law. It is certainly the
                most appropriate method of inquiring into the legal competence of a public authority. The aspects of an
                official decision or an administrative act that may be scrutinized by the judicial process are the
                competence of the public authority, the extent of a public authority's legal powers, the adequacy and
                fairness of the procedure, the evidence considered in arriving at the administrative decision and the
                motives underlying it, and the nature and scope of the discretionary power. An administrative act or
                decision can be invalidated on any of these grounds if the reviewing court or tribunal has a
                sufficiently wide jurisdiction. There is also the question of responsibility for damage caused by the
                public authority in the performance of its functions. Judicial review is less effective as a method of
                inquiring into the wisdom, expediency, or reasonableness of administrative acts, and courts and
                tribunals are unwilling to substitute their own decisions for that of the responsible authority.
                <br><br>

                Judicial review of administration varies internationally. Sweden and France, for instance, have gone as
                far as subjecting the exercise of all discretionary powers, other than those relating to foreign affairs
                and <a id="pageno">[pg:3]</a> defense, to judicial review and potential limitation. Elsewhere, a
                preoccupation with procedure results in judicial review deciding only whether the correct procedure was
                observed rather than examining the substance of the decision. <br><br>

                It is of course impractical to subject every administrative act or decision to investigation, for this
                would entail unacceptable delay. The complainant must, therefore, always make maladministration has
                occurred. out prima facie case that

                Judicial review cannot compel the state to act in a particular way because the courts concerned cannot
                impose sanctions on the government, which itself controls the use of force. Such remedies as an
                injunction, an order for specific performance, or an order for mandamus will not lie against the central
                government. These inhibitions, however, are of less practical importance than might be supposed.
                Nevertheless, nearly all governments (even revolutionary ones) are eager to proclaim the lawfulness of
                the regime and seldom disregard the decisions of an authorized court or tribunal. In judicial review of
                administration at a national level, a country's history, politics, and Constitutional theory all play
                their part. There are, broadly, three major systems: the common-law model; the French, or council of
                state model; and the procurator model.

                The judicial review of legislative enactment is, on the other hand, distinguished from that of actions
                of the executive or other authority so as the Constitutionality of an Act of legislature and the
                Constitutionality of the action taken by the authorities charged with the duty of executing that law are
                two different matters. Judicial review of legislative enactments stands in a separate class by itself.
                This is a peculiar feature of Constitutions like that of the United States of America, India and Nepal.
                There cannot be any judicial review of legislation, for instance, in a <a id="pageno">[pg:4]</a> country
                like England where the parliament is supreme and it does not have any Constitutional fetters on the
                powers of legislation. <input type="checkbox" id="fn1.5.8" /><label

                1.1.1 Grounds of Judicial Review of Legislative Acts <br><br>

                In Nepal, to date Article 107 of the Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 is a sole device of judicial
                review as well as control of both legislative and administrative laws. The Constitution has,
                accordingly, stipulated the provisions. To this, law made by parliament can be challenged on any of the
                following grounds: <input type="checkbox" id="fn1.5.9" /><label for="fn1.5.9"><sup></sup></label>

                &bull; law enacted in the absence of legislative competence;<br>
                &bull; law enacted in violation of fundamental rights; <br>
                &bull; law enacted in violation of other Constitutional restrictions;<br>
                &bull; and Law enacted in infringement
                of the principle of natural justice.
                <br><br>


                The law enacted without legislative competence on account of the violation of the rules of distribution
                of powers, or on account of the infringement of fundamental rights, or for the infringement of other
                constitutional restrictions which prohibit the legislature from enacting laws framed in the absence of
                legislative competence is still- born and void ab initio. Whereas the legislature has competence to
                enact a law, but the law is enacted in violation of some constitutional restrictions, such law is not
                still- born and void ab initio, but is only unenforceable and if the prohibitions are removed the law
                becomes enforceable. <br><br>

                1.1.2 Aims and Needs of Judicial Review <br><br>

                The crux of the system of judicial review fundamentally lies in the independence of judiciary. It is
                said that judicial independence is <a id="pageno">[pg:5]</a> maintained by the system of judicial review
                and that becomes one of the fundamental components of the constitutionalism <input type="checkbox"
                    id="fn1.6.10" /><label for="fn1.6.10"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br> 10 Modern political thought
                    draws a distinction between Constitutionalism and Constitution. A country may have the Constitution
                    but not necessarily Constitutionalism. For example, a country with a dictatorship where the
                    dictator's word is law can be said to have a Constitution but not Constitutionalism. A written
                    Constitution, independent judiciary with powers of judicial review, the doctrine of rule of law and
                    separation of powers, free elections to legislature, accountable and transparent democratic
                    government, fundamental rights of the people, federalism, decentralization of powers are some of the
                    principles and norms which promote Constitutionalism in a country. (See also Jain, supra note 1, at
                    7.)<br><br></span> and that of the rule of law. <input type="checkbox" id="fn1.6.11"><label

                    people. To A. V. Dicey it meant a wondrous thing
                    distinguishing the British from all other Constitutions of the world. (See also Jeffrey Jowell, The
                    Rule
                    of Law Today, THE CHANGING CONSTITUION (Oxford University Press ed. by Jeffrey Jowell and Dawn
                    Oliver
                    4th ed. 2000) (1994) at 4. To Ivory Jennings it meant a phrase for distinguishing democratic or
                    Constitutional government from dictatorship. (See SIR IVOR JENNINGS, THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION 60
                    (5th ed. 1958). To EP Thompson it meant a protection against, and under attack from, the encroaching
                    power of the modern state (Construed in GARY SLAPPER & DAVID KELLY, PRINCIPLES OF THE ENGLISH LEGAL
                    SYSTEM 15 (Cavendish Publishing Limited 1997). <br><br></span>

                The system of judicial review has been foresightedly in-built in the Nepalese Constitution, in order
                that the integrity of the Constitution may be preserved against any hasty or ill considered changes,

                protect fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens and to afford a useful weapon for equality,
                liberty and freedom. The system of judicial review in Nepal has not only a legal basis but also a
                philosophical and ethical foundation, and the vitality of this system stands mostly on the historical
                perspective, social and economic view of life and also on the persuasive conscience of the judiciary.

                    as Constitutional review, however the different
                    between two may be that the former is broader to that of the latter. In Constitutional review, the
                    court
                    can simply scrutinize the government action in light of the Constitution and its limitation,

                America and other country of the world. The Constitution has vested the exclusive jurisdiction in the
                Supreme Court to determine all questions relating to the constitutional validity of laws in force in the
                territory of Nepal, and to issue order for the settlement of any constitutional or legal question.<a

                In a situation, the significance of this research project will be first, to situate the changing process
                of a traditional system of judicial review into a wider historical and juridical context that takes into
                account the transformation and pluralism of norms and values. Secondly, to contribute to the study of
                system of judicial review on how the system be better understood to protect the Constitution and basic
                rights of the people. Thirdly, to contribute to the current impact of the system of judicial review in
                the legal system of a country. <br><br>

                1.2 Rationale <br><br>

                Article 88 of the 1990 Constitution and Article 107 of the Interim Constitution has vested the exclusive
                jurisdiction to the Supreme Court of Nepal to determine all questions relating to the constitutional
                validity of laws in force in the territory of Nepal, and issue order for the settlement of any
                constitutional or legal question involved in any dispute of "Public Interest" or concern. These Articles
                also give 'unlimited" grounds for locus standi. According to which, any Nepal citizen can sue a writ
                petition in the Supreme Court challenging the legislative and administrative actions on <a
                    id="pageno">[pg:8]</a>the grounds that they are inconsistent and contrary to the provisions of the
                Constitution. <br><br>


                The writ petition to be filed in the Supreme Court may require to satisfy either one of the following
                grounds: they include to have any law or any part thereof declared void on the ground of inconsistency
                with the Constitution, or to seek order for the enforcement of the fundamental rights conferred by the
                Constitution, or to seek order for the enforcement of any other legal right for which no other remedy
                has been provided or for which the remedy even though provided appears to be inadequate or ineffective,
                or to seek order for the settlement of any constitutional or legal question involved in any dispute of
                public interest or concern. Subject to these constitutional provisions, some questions are yet to be
                responded analytically and researchfully in Nepal. They include: is judicial review a good idea? Is this
                system essential for the upholdment of constitutional supremacy? Has our judiciary assessed the system
                in line with the intention of Constitution? These are a few but moot questions concerning with the
                system of judicial review, which need to be critically and duly studied, analyzed and responded.<br><br>


                1.3 Statement of the Problem <br><br>

                A study on judicial review is usually emphasized on the normative contents of state's framework on
                Constitution, on the one hand, while, on the other hand neglecting the cognitive ones and the actual
                constraints in the system is lacking. Obviously, considering only the normative contents of judicial
                review would not lead us to a better understanding of how in actual life the system has been working
                for. For better understand of the system the cognitive contents of judicial review is essentially a
                vital. In this circumstance, the researcher proposes some theoretical considerations. There are, in
                particular, three theoretical problems in understanding the system of judicial review in the context of
                Nepal. First, the question of the adequacy of scope and limitations dealing with the<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:9]</a> issue of judicial review, secondly, the question of the adequacy of the
                application of the system of
                judicial review into a real life, and thirdly, the question of the adequacy of the changing nature of
                the system of judicial review and its current impact in the domestic legal system. In addition, there is
                also a practical problem, i.e. the assessment of the functioning of system in Nepal. <br><br>

                1.4 Objectives <br><br>

                The objective of the study is intended to achieve the following: <br>

                &bull; Present a picture of the study of judicial review in its historical, theoretical and practical
                aspects;
                which will describe about the nature, functions, limitations, practices and trends related to the
                study;<br>

                &bull; Understand the changing process of judicial review on the legal system and its current impact on
                Nepalese judicial system; <br>

                &bull;Understand the trends of judiciary toward the system;

                and<br>

                &bull; Make an assessment of the functioning of a system in a domestic situation. <br>

                Based upon these objectives, the study has primarily dealt with the fundamental concept of judicial
                review; including its meaning, scope, and philosophy; rules determining the Constitutionality of the
                government action including legislation; reasons for vesting the power of judicial review in the
                judiciary; need and rationale of judicial review; models of judicial review; grounds and limits of
                judicial review; Constitutional doctrine of judicial review; the origins of judicial review; the
                Constitution of Nepal and its related provision; judicial trends and its assessment and so on.<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:10]</a> <br><br>

                1.5 Research Questions <br><br>

                In order to accomplish the objectives set out in the research plan, the researcher has raised some
                relevant research questions: <br><br>

                1. Questions related to the traditional process of judicial review and

                its origin in the constitutional jurisprudence: <br><br>

                a. What was the traditional process of judicial review? What factors gave away the birth to judicial
                review? <br>

                b. What was the system of judicial review like prior to the pronouncement of John Marshall in Marbury v.
                Madison? What shape was given to the system by the Marbury case? <br><br>

                2. Questions related to the changing process of judicial review and its impact on judicial system and on
                the doctrine of separation of powers: <br><br>

                a. What major changes are brought in the process of judicial review? <br>

                b. What impact is caused against judicial system and separation of powers by judicial review? <br>

                c. Granting that a Constitution must be supreme over contrary law, why are the courts the final body to
                decide when a law is in fact contrary to the Constitution? It is true that the judges take an oath to
                support the Constitution, but all legislators executive and judicial officers of the state are similarly
                bound by oath. Then how can one branch of government/state, the judiciary, be supreme over a coordinate
                branch? <br>

                d. Can democracy exist when the courts are not the final arbiters? In England, parliament can change
                judicial decisions by statute. The French have clung tenaciously <a id="pageno">[pg:11]</a>to the idea
                that no judicial organ should be given the

                power to review statutes for conformity with a higher

                law. Until recently such control has been, at best.

                theoretical, and has always been entrusted to specifically political bodies. <br><br>


                3. Questions related to trends and assessment of judicial review

                held by the Supreme Court of Nepal:<br><br>
                a. What are the trends of judiciary grown up into the

                system of judicial review? <br>
                b. What practice is held thereon? <br>

                c. What are the findings of the assessment of the system? <br>

                1.6 Scope <br><br>

                The scope of the study has mainly been confined within the existing provisions, practices, issues and
                trends reflected on the system of judicial review. It is primarily focused on the judicial review of
                legislation and of administrative actions. The focus and attention has been given to the description and
                analysis of the Nepalese provisions and trends relating to the study. <br><br>

                The work also analyzes the different aspects of judicial review of the Constitutionality of government
                actions and assesses the role of the ape judiciary. <br><br>

                1.7 Research Project <br><br>

                As the study is purely a part of academic research, the research proj has been basically carried out in
                three phases:<a id="pageno">[pg:12]</a> The first phase was comprised of aggregation of extensive
                literatures, in this stage the researcher depended on secondary data information including books, laws,
                court decisions, journals, periodicals, reports, and research findings made by any researcher in this
                regard

                The second phase of the study involved with the extensive review of

                aggregated literatures.

                The third phase of the study consisted of data analysis and the write up

                of the final report in the form of a thesis. <br><br>

                1.8 Research Process and Methodology <br><br>

                The following methodological variables have been adopted in carrying out the study: <br><br>

                a. Published materials concerning the theme of the study have been thoroughly studied and scrutinized in
                order to use them as source materials. The main sources of information in this regard are the primary
                and secondary sources. The primary sources such as the constitutional documents, various law statutes,
                rules etc. are used to describe the legal and constitutional provisions. The secondary sources such as
                the relevant scholastic books, comments, law journals, periodicals, articles, etc. gave an insight into
                the understanding and appreciation of the issue. <br><br>

                b. The use of case study method has enriched the study. Almost all the recorded cases on judicial review
                have been critically reviewed and analyzed. This method has been adopted with a view to assessing the
                role of judiciary as a custodian of fundamental rights and also to scrutinizing its trends and practices
                toward the system of judicial review. <a id="pageno">[pg:13]</a>Rules of citation follow The Uniform

                1.9 Organization of the study <br><br>


                The study has been organized into seven parts The first part deals with the general introduction,
                structure and methodology of the study. In this stage, it involves some elementary questions and
                indicates answers why the study matters. <br><br>

                Chapter two consists of the review of literatures. Some prominent works done in the area of judicial
                review and pronouncements made by the judiciary in this connection are reviewed in this phase. <br><br>

                Chapter three outlines the fundamental concepts of Constitution, judicial review and fundamental rights
                and examines their inter-relationships. It sates that Constitution, fundamental rights and judicial
                review are interrelated and interdependent. They cannot be divorced from each other. The thesis inbuilt
                in this chapter is that there can be no Constitution without fundamental rights, no fundamental rights
                without judicial review and non all of these without independent, competent and impartial judiciary.
                <br><br>

                Chapter four outlines about the origins and evolution of the system of judicial review. It also makes a
                comparative study with special references of the experiences of USA, UK, and India on the systems of
                judicial review. <br><br>

                Chapter five is all about the Nepalese context. It deals with a system of judicial review in Nepal with
                a special focus on prehistory and early history of Nepal, evolution of judicial review and its trends.<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:14]</a> Chapter six makes the assessment of the practice of judicial review in
                Nepal. It has pointed out some judicial constraints reflected in the area of judicial review in the
                Nepalese context. <br><br>

                Summary and conclusions are made in the last part. Besides, the thesis is also followed by
                bibliographies and other relevant notes. <br><br>

                1.10 Limitation of the Study <br><br>

                One of the major problems encountered in course of this study was the absence of such publications which
                could provide consolidated information concerning the state of judicial review in Nepal during the
                period ranging from the first Constitutional enactment of 1948 up to the present time. The works done in
                this area have revealed different and sometimes contrast remarks on judicial review to each other. This
                made researcher hard to consolidate ideas and come to the conclusion. Another constraint revolved around
                the study is that as all the judgments of court were in Nepali language, the researcher was compelled to
                translate them into English, which consumed more time to complete the assignment, <br><br>

                When the study was under the phase of writing, the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) of the country launched
                agitation programs around the country. A series of waves of arrests of opposition leaders were
                conducted. The agitations reached a peak around the February 8 municipal elections, which were boycotted
                by the SPA and the Maoists. The SPA called for a four-day nationwide general strike on April 5-9. The
                Maoists called for a cease-fire in the Kathmandu valley. The general strike saw numerous protests. A
                curfew was announced by the government on April 8, with orders to shoot protestors on sight.<br><br>

                On April 9, the SPA announced that it intended to continue its protests indefinitely and called for a
                tax boycott. The government announced plans to step up its enforcement of the curfew and claimed that
                the Maoists had <a id="pageno">[pg:15]</a> infiltrated the protests. Protests continued in the following
                days, with crowds increasing to sizes estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 in Kathmandu in various estimates,
                more than 10% of the city population. On April 21, some million people took part in the protests in
                Kathmandu. It was continued till the King Gyanendra announced that he had returned all his power to the
                people and reinstated the House of Representatives. Thus, the national tension of the year 2005 and 2006
                also resulted some barriers to the smoothness of study. Review of newly promulgated Interim Constitution
                2007 was additional work load for the researcher.<a id="pageno">[pg:16]</a> <br><br>

                <p> CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE<br><br>

                    The literature reviewed in the process of study can be broadly divided into two categories: the
                    primary and the secondary sources. The primary sources used in the study include constitutional
                    documents, bare Acts, rules and case studies. As far the secondary sources are concerned, the
                    relevant scholastic books, comments, law journals, periodicals, articles have been consulted to give
                    an insight into the understanding and appreciation of the issue. The review of some 500 noted
                    judgments of the Supreme Court on judicial review is, as a part of case study, significant work done
                    by the researcher.<br><br>

                    The prominent secondary sources reviewed in the study are as follows:<br><br>

                    Judicial Review and the Law of the Constitution is a spirited, scholarly and sympathetic defense of
                    Marshall's chief justiceship. Through careful reading and analysis, Snowiss has demonstrated, in
                    clear and elegant prose, the manner in which Marshall was far more formidable judicial tactician
                    than modern scholars have commonly believed. Equally importantly, she has revealed with consummate
                    subtlety the legacy which Marshall has bequeathed to the practice of modern judicial review.<a

                    origin of judicial review. Tracing the development of judicial review from American independence
                    through the tenure of John Marshall as Chief Justice, Snowies offers a new perspective on
                    assumptions about intent and the status of Constitutional text made both implicitly and explicitly
                    by contending sides in the fundamental rights debate. More importantly, it reopens and recasts the
                    most basic and enduring problem of American Constitutional law the relationship between its legal
                    and political components.<br>

                Snowiss argues that originally Constitutional limits were understood to be a statement of first
                political principles committed to writing. Through carefully crafted opinions and without public
                recognition, Marshall transformed these principles into supreme written law. Simultaneously he changed
                judicial review from the defence of principle in circumstances of clear violation into routine
                application and interpretation of Constitutional text. In her last chapter, Snowiss probes the
                implications of this analysis for contemporary controversies about judicial review. Her interpretation
                offers a new perspective on assumptions about intent and the status of Constitutional text made both
                implicitly and explicitly by contending sides in the fundamental rights debate. More important, it
                reopens and recasts the most basic and enduring problems of American Constitutional law- the
                relationship between its legal and political components. <br><br>

                Snowiss writes -for a long time the question of whether the framers of the USA Constitution intended to
                establish judicial review of legislation was the subject of extensive and repeated investigation. There
                has been no definite resolution of the issue, the consequence; it is widely agreed, of ambiguities and
                internal contradictions in the early record. More recently interest in intent on the establishment of
                judicial review has been declined, along with fundamental opposition to the practice.<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:19]</a> The other way to that of inquiry rests with the assumption that the framers
                contemplated some kind of judicial review, Snowiss reopens the question of intent on the establishment
                of judicial review itself and present still another interpretation of its origin one that removes the
                inconclusiveness and ambiguities of existing interpretations and resolves the purported inconsistencies
                of the pre-Marshall record. The reinterpretation presented here uses no new material but consists in a
                rereading of existing sources. <br><br>

                Snowiss argues that although there was substantial support for a judicial check on legislation before
                John Marshall assumed the chief justiceships of the US Supreme Court, the check then contemplated was
                fundamentally different from that which Marshall built. Snowiss further argues that Marshall's role was
                far more innovative and decisive than has ever been recognized. <br><br>

                This work is primarily an attempt to answer unanswered historical questions. At the same time, the
                reinterpretation of intent offered here is not only a historical interest by can contribute to the
                contemporary debate over the proper practice of judicial review. <br><br>

                Snowiss argues that judicial review was developed over three distinct periods: from Independence to
                Federalist 78; Federalist 78 to Marbury; and from Marbury to the end of Marshall's tenure on the Court.
                During the first period judicial authority over unconstitutional acts was often claimed, but its
                legitimacy was just as often denied. In this unresolved controversy, judicial invalidation of
                legislation remained an essentially controversial practice. The judicial authority to enforce the
                Constitution asserted in period 1 was understood to be an extraordinary political act, a judicial
                substitute for revolution. Period 1 judges were closer to outdated English precedent than subsequent
                American doctrine.<a id="pageno">[pg:20]</a> Period 2 provided the coherent defense of judicial
                authority over unconstitutional legislation that had been absent in period 1. It was presented first by
                James Iredell in a North Carolina newspaper in 1786 and reformulated and popularized by Alexander
                Hamilton in Federalist 78 and James Wilson in Lectures on the Law'. Period 2 judicial review, first, was
                not derived from the written Constitution, but from the existence in the American states of real,
                explicit social contracts or fundamental law, which came into being in the aftermath of the
                revolutionary break from England. Next, period 2 judicial review maintained the period 1 understanding
                that judicial enforcement of the Constitution was an extraordinary political act, a judicial substitute
                for revolution. Period 2 judicial review, furthermore, derived its authority over legislation from
                equality of the government branches under explicit fundamental law, not, as does the Marbury doctrine,
                from a uniquely judicial responsibility to a written Constitution. Last, its exercise was accomplished
                by political restraints appropriate for judicial defense of fundamental law. <br><br>

                Period 3 began with Marshall's assumption of the chief justiceships and consisted of his reworking of
                the period 2 position. In this period, Marshall, first, ended seriatim opinion writing and, with it,
                public airing of alternate approaches to fundamental law. Next, under this near monopoly of opinion
                writing, he introduced an unprecedented application to the Constitution of the rules for statutory
                interpretation, an application not to be found in period 2 cases or in the court, concurring, or
                dissenting opinions of his Supreme Court colleagues. Last, he affected a seemingly slight but portentous
                shift in the significance to be attributed to the written Constitution. In Marshall's hands the written
                Constitution lost its period 2 meaning as vehicle of explicit fundamental law and became instead
                testimony to the Constitution's status as supreme ordinary law.<a id="pageno">[pg:21]</a> <br><br>

                V. S. Deshpande<br>
                Judicial Review of Legislation<br>
                <i>Eastern Book Company, Lucknow, India (1977) </i> <br><br>

                Deshpande in his outstanding work argues that judicial review of legislation is a result of two of the
                most fundamental features of the constitutional law. The first is the two tier system of law with the
                Constitution as the supreme law and other legislation being the ordinary law which is valid only in so
                far as it is consistent with the Constitution. The second is the separation of the legislative, the
                executive and the judicial powers of the state. <br><br>

                He argues that under judicial review there is a two-fold limitation on the validity of the statutes.
                First, the legislature must have the competence to enact them, and next they must not conflict with the
                Constitution. The subject of judicial review has, therefore, two aspects. One is like a foundational
                course of study of the subject, which is entirely objective in approach and is concerned with the
                exercise of the judicial function and its relationship with the legislative function. The adjudication
                of the constitutionality of a statute, the effects of unconstitutionality and the cure of the vice of
                unconstitutionality and the elated topics fall in its ambit. The other aspect involves the study and
                interpretation of the Constitution itself. It inquires into the philosophy of the Constitution as seen
                differently from different standpoints with different backgrounds. It is comparatively more subjective.
                <br><br>

                Deshpande argues that the two trends appeared in the development of human rights which had an impact on
                the growth of judicial review of legislation. First is with regard to the right to property. Initially,
                the right to property was regarded as valuable as the other human rights. In the Universal Declaration
                of Human Rights, it found a place in Article 17. But with the awakening of the masses all over the
                world, measures of social amelioration came into conflict with the rights of property asserted by the<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:22]</a> placed individuals. The result was that the right to property was dropped
                from the list of human rights in 1966 when the Covenants on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and on
                Civil and Political Rights were adopted by most of the countries of the UN. The other trend is conflict
                arising out of between the right to property and liberty. <br><br>

                Deshpande analyzing the bases and grounds of judicial review argues that the power of judicial review of
                legislation is given to the judiciary both by the political theory and the text of the Constitution. In
                political theory, the Constitutions the result of an expression of the general will of the community as
                a whole. And, in textual basis contents of the Constitution provide bases and grounds for judicial
                review. Moreover, he answers to the question such as what are the grounds on which legislation can be
                invalidated by the courts. To him, these grounds had to be found only in Articles 372(1) 13 in respect
                of pre-Constitutional laws; and Art. 245(1) in respect of post constitutional laws; (of the Indian
                Constitution). Taking them together, courts have generally considered the causes of the invalidated of
                statutes as falling into two classes, namely, (a) want of legislative competence in the legislature to
                make the particular statute; and (b) the repugnancy of the statute with the Constitution particularly
                with part III of the Constitution(legislative competence and inconsistence with the Constitution).
                Strictly speaking, these categories exhaust the Constitutional grounds on which a statute could be held
                to be invalid. <br><br>

                Deshpande also highlights about two systems of judicial review. One system (that, for instance, of
                Columbia, South America) is that a petition of unconstitutionality is brought against the statute itself
                by any person, regardless of whether or not he alleges any immediate interest, directly in the supreme
                court, whose decision does not rule on the rights of a plaintiff against a defendant, but directly upon
                the validity of the statute, a ruling of unconstitutionality having the same effect as repealing the
                statute. The <a id="pageno">[pg:23]</a> system, to which Columbia developed in 1910, enables any person,
                with or without a locus standi, as we understand the term, to bring an action directly against the
                statute itself as distinguished from an action against the government or against any other person. The
                second system of judicial review of legislation is the one prevailing in the United States of America.
                This goes to the other extreme by confining the power to raise the issue of Constitutionality only to a
                person who has the locus standi to do so. The issue can come before a court only in a form of litigation
                between two parties or between a party and the state. <br><br>

                Dr. Chakradhar Jha<br>

                Judicial Review of Legislative Acts<br>

                <i>N. M. Tripathi Put. Ltd., Bombay (1974)</i> <br><br>

                Jha discusses judicial review of legislative acts in the context of history and also in its theoretical
                and practical aspects. He has a strong belief that in a state where the Constitutional supremacy
                prevails the Constitution can remain a living moral and intellectual force only by the system of
                judicial review.<br><br>

                Jha in his great writing mentions- the process of judicial scrutiny of the legislative acts on the
                touchstone of Constitution is technically called judicial review'. The doctrine of judicial review is
                the enforcement of the rights assured and guaranteed under the Constitution through constitutional
                remedies. It is the protector of fundamental rights and a living product of democracy. The fundamental
                object of judicial review is to exert a great moral force upon the legislature to keep it within the
                limits of the Constitution and to save the people from the democratic tyranny.<br><br>

                Jha argues that in judicial review of legislative acts it becomes fundamentally necessary to know the
                concept of Constitution and nature and aspects of sovereignty. It is because judicial review has grown
                with the evolution of the Constitution. Constitutional evolutions of many<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:24]</a>countries reveal the enormous increase in the power of the court to review
                the Constitutionality of the legislative acts. The reason is that the concept of sovereignty of the
                people is the original concept of the Constitutional jurisprudence and it has received a more
                strengthening force from the growth of various social and economic complexities. The individual liberty
                and freedom are generally eclipsed under the shadow of social needs and it is why judicial review is
                essential to save the personal rights of the individual.<br><br>

                Jha argues that the most predominating condition of judicial review is the concept of popular
                sovereignty and Constitutional supremacy. Where parliamentary sovereignty prevails, as in England, there
                is no scope of judicial review. The Basic English Constitutional concept is that the people are the
                source of all powers, and they seized all essential Constitutional powers from the monarch and reposed
                them in parliament. At the time of law making the whole people of England are supposed to be present in
                parliament and as such each parliamentary enactment is necessarily the verdict of the whole people which
                can be changed and repealed only by the verdict of the whole people by another parliamentary enactment.
                But in India, as in America, the concept of popular sovereignty prevails which means that the
                legislature is the mere agent of the sovereign people and as such any enactment by the agent of the
                people is liable to be scrutinized in the court of law to ascertain if the impugned legislative
                enactment is against the mandate of the people incorporated in the Constitution.<br><br>

                <i>Little, Brown and Company, Toronto (1965)</i> <br><br>

                Louis's Judicial Control of Administrative Action is a series of articles of the author, most of them
                published in the Harvard Law Review. These articles have focused on the relation between the agencies
                and the courts. This<a id="pageno">[pg:25]</a> work has extensively presented about the 'growth of the
                administrative processes, 'delegation of legislative power', 'the system of judicial remedy', the
                judicial enforcement of administrative orders' and etc..<br><br>

                Louis argues that a system of judicial remedies for the supervision of administrative action should
                strive for three objectives: comprehensiveness, simplicity, and predictability. According to him, the
                systems of judicial remedies derive from two main sources. There are, first, a group of statutes which
                establish an agency and incorporate provisions for the review of its actions. There is, second, a brace
                of remedies which have developed by the combined action of the common law and statutes consolidating,
                simplifying, or in some other way reforming the common law remedies. These remedies are certiorari,
                mandamus, prohibition, habeas corpus, quo-warranto (the so-called prerogative writs) damage suits, the
                bill in equity, and defense to enforcement proceedings. <br><br>

                This work was particularly useful to the researcher to learn about the origins of prerogative writs and
                their functions as a system of judicial remedies.<br><br>

                Mauro and John speaking on the origins of judicial review of legislation argue that from the political
                experience of the United Nations the defeated nations, in an endeavor to prevent a return of the
                autocratic governments that were held responsible for the outbreak and more than their share of the
                atrocities of two world wars and to establish a better political order borrowed the doctrine of judicial
                supremacy which gives the courts the power and obligation to declare invalid all law that is
                incompatible with <a id="pageno">[pg:26]</a> the Constitution. By endowing their regular courts or some
                specially established court with that power, the framers hoped to ensure the preservation in their
                countries of a system of government that would foster the growth of liberal democracy. Other European
                nations have also adopted this striking peculiarity of the United States System of Government. Thus, in
                the last half century. Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Cyprus, Turkey and Yugoslavia instituted
                systems of judicial review of legislation, while Switzerland and Norway have employed such a system for
                almost one hundred years. Austria became the first country to adopt judicial review of legislation by
                the federal Constitution of October 1, 1920; similarly Yugoslavia became the first communist state to
                adopt judicial review, having done so in 1963.<br><br>

                The least empirical jurist or political scientist, however, would be wary of asserting that an ordering
                of the hierarchy of power as obvious, as reasonable, and as fundamental as that which leads to judicial
                review of legislation could have been invented as late as the end of the eighteenth century. It is true
                that the peculiar political environment existing in the United States at that time provided fertile soil
                for the successful development of judicial review. It is also true that the political bases of the
                English revolution of 1688 and of the French revolution of 1789 were hostile to such a doctrine. But
                they should not be interpreted as indicating a total absence of the practice in the European
                tradition.<br><br>

                Mauro and John with the analysis of traditions of judicial review in Europe also highlighted about the
                latter development of European systems of judicial review concerning principally with three aspects of
                the phenomenon: (1) the organs in which the power of judicial review resides, (2) the procedures by
                which questions of Constitutionality are resolved, and (3) the effects of a finding of
                unconstitutionality on the law under review and on the specific case (if there be one) that gave rise to
                the Constitutional question.<a id="pageno">[pg:27]</a><br><br>


                An excellent article of a comparison of the American and European systems of judicial review of
                legislation concludes that judicial review is in essence an endeavor to judge positive law in the light
                of ultimate values. It is means by which human aspirations, as expressed in constitutional absolutes,
                are concretized into a living Constitution.<br><br>

                Judicial Review and Judicial Activism <br>
                Deep & Deep Publications, New Delhi (1997)<br><br>

                This study presented by Bhatia is designed to provide insights into the perceptions and contours of
                judicial review and judicial activism in India and Germany. It is a comparative study of Constitutions
                and administrative laws of both countries from which Bhatia has made an initiative for a progressive
                development of law.<br><br>

                This study presents some aspects of positive side as well as negative side of the Indian and German
                systems of judicial review; it also presents some of the advantages and shortcomings of judicial
                activism of both the systems. It explores the notion that judicial review is not concerned with the
                decision of an administrative authority but with its decision-making process.<br><br>

                The study unfolds that the individual either in India or in Germany is protected against any invasion or
                breach or infringement of his fundamental right or basic right or ordinary right by the executive- a
                wonderland of bureaucracy - through the instrumentality of judicial review.<br><br>

                Bhatia writes that the courts whether in India or Germany have a valuable as well as indispensable role
                in the administrative process though through different routes and mechanisms, viz., judicial process
                intends to censor or control the executive with a sole purpose that an administrative <a
                    id="pageno">[pg:28]</a>authority behaves in such a way that it must reach just ends by just means'
                <br><br>

                Judicial review, to Bhatia, is an amour to check lawlessness- legislative as well as executive. In India
                right from the inception of the Constitution, the judicial review has effectively been exercised and any
                endeavor to undermine or crumble its sanctity has been counter productive, i.e. struck down because it
                being the basic structure of the 'grundnorm., to him the Constitution.<br><br>

                Bhatia has presented judicial review as a foolproof system to combat the arbitrary, unreasonable,
                illegal, biased, non-reasoned, and incompatible. To streamline the notion of judicial review in the area
                of administrative law the institution of Ombudsman is coming up to cleansing the administration from
                varied ills. But the moot question is that has Ombudsman become a substitute for judicial review in
                monitoring the administrative process at the central and local levels of administration or a panacea for
                its ills?<br><br>

                V. G. Ramachandran<br>

                Law of Writs<br>

                <i>Eastern Book Company, Lucknow, India (1993)</i> <br><br>

                Ramchandran's Law of Writs is the book which deals very exhaustively and exclusively with the practice
                of prerogative writs in India. This book was quite useful for the researcher to understand general
                principles of writ jurisdiction which is very much essential in the study of judicial review. <br><br>

                The court, in exercise of judicial review, is not concerned with the correctness of the findings of fact
                on the basis of which the orders are made so long as those findings are reasonable and supported by
                evidence. The court does not substitute its judgment for that of the legislature or its<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:29]</a> agents as to matters within the province of either. The court does not
                supplant the feel of the expert' by its own view. When the legislature acts within the sphere of its
                authority and delegates power to an agent, it may empower the agent to make findings of fact which are
                conclusive provided such findings satisfy the test of reasonableness. In all such cases, judicial
                inquiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are reasonably based on evidence and
                whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land. <br><br>

                Finally, judicial review is directed not against the decision, but is confined to the examination of the
                decision-making process.<br><br>

                Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision was
                made and it would be an error to think that the court sits in judgment not only on the correctness of
                the decision making process but also on the correctness of the decision itself.<br><br>

                In the state where the written Constitution is adopted, the power of the judicial review is accepted as
                the heart and core of the Constitution.<br><br>

                Constitutional & Administrative Law<br>

                <i>Cavendish Publishing Limited, London (2000)</i> <br><br>

                Barnett's Constitutional and Administrative Law provides an exposition of the major features of the
                United Kingdom's Constitution and incorporates their recent developments. It enabled the researcher to
                understand about the structure of the United Kingdom, the sources of the Constitution and their
                fundamental concepts which are analyzed in the first two parts of the book. This book perceives that
                Constitution is concerned with the roles and powers of the institutions within the state and with the
                relationship between the citizen and the state. It also perceives that the Constitution is a living,
                dynamic organism which at any point in time will reflect the<a id="pageno">[pg:30]</a> <br><br>moral and
                political values of the people it governs, and accordingly, the law of the Constitution must be
                appreciated within the socio-political context in which it operates.<br><br>

                H. W. R. Wade and C. F. Forsyth <br>

                Administrative Law<br>

                <i>Clarendon Press, Oxford (1994)</i> <br><br>

                Wade's Administrative Law is considered a classic work on English administrative law. The book has,
                among others, analyzed the Constitutional foundations of the powers of the court, particularly, the rule
                of law, sovereignty of parliament, doctrine of ultra-vires, prerogative remedies and procedure of
                judicial review. Dealing with the doctrine of ultra-vires, the book states that the ultra-vires doctrine
                is not confined to cases of plain excess of power; it also governs abuse of power, as where something is
                done unjustifiably, for the wrong reasons or by the wrong procedure. In law the consequences are exactly
                the same: an improper motive, or a false step in procedure, makes an administrative act just as illegal
                as does a flagrant excess of authority.<br><br>

                It views that the system of judicial review is radically different from the system of appeals. When
                hearing an appeal, the court is concerned with the merits of the decision under appeal. When subjecting
                some administrative act or order to judicial review, the court is concerned with its legality. On an
                appeal the question is right or wrong? On review the question is lawful or unlawful?<br><br>

                Further, the rights of appeal are always statutory. Judicial review, on the other hand, is the exercise
                of the court's inherent power to determine whether action is lawful or not and to award suitable relief.
                For this, no statutory authority is necessary: the court is simply performing its ordinary functions in
                order to uphold the rule of law. The basis of judicial review, therefore, is common law. Since rights of
                appeal exist only where<a id="pageno">[pg:31]</a>conferred by statute, in modern law there is no
                inherent appellate jurisdiction in the courts.<br><br>

                Judicial review is a fundamentally different operation. Instead of substituting its own decision for
                that of some other body, as happens when an appeal is allowed, the court on review is concerned only
                with the question whether the act or order under attack should be allowed to stand or not.<br><br>

                Judicial control, therefore, primarily means review, and is based on a fundamental principle, inherent
                throughout the legal system, that powers can be validly exercised only within their true limits. Rights
                of appeal, on the other hand, have no such central place.<br><br>

                The author thus concludes that many of the most difficult problems of judicial review are concerned with
                the question where power stops and duty begins. Even if the authority has undoubted power to do
                something, there may be duties as to how it is to be done.<br><br>

                S. P. Sathe<br>

                Judicial Activism in India <br>
                <i>Oxford University Press, New Delhi (2002)</i> <br><br>

                This work has been done in light of the Indian experiences examined in the area of judicial review and
                judicial activism. It looks the issues in a different angle and analyses accordingly. In fact, the
                strength of Sathe's work in this book lies in delineating diverse traditions of judicial review and
                judicial activism in a comparative context. This book reveals at least two kinds of judicial activism at
                work in India: reactionary and progressive. Much of the Nehruvian era activism in issues of land reforms
                and right to property, and the pro-emergency activism manifests 'reactionary' judicial activism. The
                'progressive' judicial activism commences with Golaknath and Kesavananda and culminates in a wholly<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:32]</a>different genre of social action litigation. This book illustrates how
                fragile as well as fractured progressive activism is. <br><br>

                In this work, Sathe is not overly concerned with the tasks of construction of the meanings of judicial
                activism. He remains concerned with the more important issues of its 'efficacy' and 'legitimacy'. His
                principle message is that judicial activism is a form of state power inherent at odds with itself. Or,
                he wanted to say is that justices can be activists only within the confines of the traditions of
                administration of justice. They may expand and enhance that tradition but their work remains tradition-
                constituted.<br><br>

                Sathe sees judicial review and its role in democracy a crucial. To him, judicial review means overseeing
                by the judiciary of the exercise of power by other co-ordinate organs of government with a view to
                ensuring that they remain confined to the limits drawn upon their powers by the Constitution. In
                democratizing societies, he believes, judicial review can contribute towards the deepening of the
                commitment to Constitutional values. And, the Indian experience of judicial review needs to be seen in
                this light. Judicial review under a written Constitution with a bill of rights cannot remain merely
                technocratic because the expressions used in the bill of rights, such as 'equality before the law',
                equal protection of law', 'personal liberty', 'the procedure established by law' or 'freedom of speech
                and expression' are open-textured and continue to acquire new meanings as society evolves and social
                change occurs.<br><br>

                Sathe writes there are two models of judicial review. One is a technocratic model in which judges act
                merely as technocrats and hold a law invalid if it is ultra vires' the powers of legislature. In the
                second model, a court interprets the provisions of a Constitution liberally and in the light of the
                spirit underlying it keeps the Constitution abreast of the times through dynamic interpretation. A court
                giving new meaning to a provision so as to suit the changing social or economic conditions or expanding
                the horizons of the rights of the individual is said to be an activist court.<a
                    id="pageno">[pg:33]</a><br><br>

                Judicial activism can be positive as well as negative. A court engaged in altering the power relations
                to make them more equitable is said to be positively activist and a court using its integrity to
                maintain the status quo in power relations is said to be negatively activist.<br><br>

                Sathe believes that judicial review means scrutiny of the acts of other organs of government by the
                courts to make sure that they act within the limits of their competence as drawn by the Constitution.
                Judicial review is to be found in England, Canada, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Sri Lanka,
                Pakistan and Bangladesh.<br><br>

                Judicial review originated in England, where the courts reviewed the acts of the executive to ensure
                that they lay within the limits of its competence drawn by parliamentary statues. Although in England
                the courts did not hold the acts of parliament invalid, judicial review of legislative acts has always
                been in vogue in the colonies. Colonial legislatures were, unlike British Parliament, not supreme and
                their powers were circumscribed by the provisions of the constituent acts enacted by British
                Parliament.<br><br>

                The courts in India, therefore began exercising judicial review of legislation ever since the first act
                of British Parliament enacted in 1885. In 'Express v. Burah and Book Singh' the Calcutta High Court
                enunciated the principle of judicial review as follows: <i>the theory of every government with a written
                    Constitution forming the fundamental and paramount law of the nation must be an Act of legislature
                    repugnant to the Constitution is void. If void, it cannot bind the courts, and oblige them to give
                    it effect; for this would be to overthrow in fact what was established in theory and make that
                    operative in law which was not law.</i> <br><br>

                Where a judge interprets a Constitution, which is organic law, the scope of choice is much wider. A
                Constitution often contains expressions that are open-textured and conceptual. A court giving meanings
                to the expressions<a id="pageno">[pg:34]</a>such as 'equality before the law and equal protection of
                law' and so forth is discoursing on political philosophy but, unlike a philosopher, a judge is
                constrained by the practical limits of the need to operationalize his philosophy.<br><br>

                Under judicial review, it is one thing to consider whether a legislature has acted within its powers and
                another to consider whether its acts even though within its plenary powers are violative of any of the
                basic rights of the people.<br><br>

                India has had judicial review of legislation since the colonial period. The courts, however, observed
                maximum restraint in dealing with the acts of legislatures.<br><br>

                Sathe also highlights that judicial review of legislation became the most significant aspect of American
                Constitutional law. Although the Constitution nowhere mentions that the supreme court of the United
                States has power to invalidate the acts of Congress if they are contrary to the provisions of the
                Constitution, Chief Justice Marshall held in Marbury v. Madison' that such power was implied in a
                written Constitution. This assertion of power was criticized severely. The critics said that it amounted
                to usurpation of power by the court. The main thrust of the criticism was that an unelected court was to
                censor the legislation enacted by an elected legislature.<br><br>

                The Federalist Papers is considered as the most important work in political science that has ever been
                written, or is likely ever to be written, in the United States. This is one of the most authoritative
                commentaries on the Constitution of the United States. The Federalist is essentially a<a

                    THE CONCEPT OF JUDICIAL REVIEW <br><br>

                    3.1 General Overview<br><br>

                    Like the statement, as observed by Clinton Rossiter in his introduction to The Federalist Papers, of
                    The Federalist 'no happiness without liberty, no liberty without self government, no self government
                    without Constitutionalism, no Constitutionalism without morality- and none of these great goods
                    without stability and order', <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.39.17" /><label for="fn3.39.17">

                        FEDERALIST PAPER, A Mentor Book, USA. (1961). <br><br></span> the author in this thesis
                    stipulates the hypothesis that;

                <blockquote> there can be no Constitution without fundamental rights, no fundamental rights without
                    judicial review and none of these without independent, impartial and competent judicial system.
                    Thus, this thesis is based on the basic presumption that the fundamental rights, in other word,
                    peoples' sovereignty and independent, impartial and competent judiciary are the core values of
                    judicial review, without which the whole system of judicial review including constitutionalism
                    becomes futile.</blockquote>

                Constitution, fundamental rights and judicial review are interrelated and interdependent. Constitution
                and fundamental rights cannot be divorced from judicial review. Nor can judicial review be divorced from
                fundamental rights and Constitution. That is why it is said that there will be no Constitution without
                fundamental rights, no fundamental rights without judicial review, and no judicial review with out
                competent, impartial and independent judiciary. Thus, the forth- coming sections have dealt with the
                basic philosophy of Constitution, fundamental rights and their relationship with the system of judicial
                review.<br><br>

                3.2 The Concept of Constitution<br><br>

                To ascertain the various aspects of judicial review, it is manifestly necessary to deal with the
                fundamental concept of a Constitution. Defining the Constitution is one of the tasks of understanding
                the system of judicial review. Constitution is meant too many things to many people. Some would say that
                a Constitution is the whole body of fundamental rules, written and unwritten, according to which a
                particular government operates. <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.40.18" /><label

                law by which sovereign powers of the government are established, distributed, limited, confined and
                regulated. <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.40.19" /><label

                and it is an instrument from which comes the power to govern.<input type="checkbox"

                designed not for one era but only for the vicissitudes of time. It is a compendium, not a code; a
                declaration of faith, not a compilation of law and etc.<input type="checkbox" id="fn3.40.21" /><label

                In particular, based on the British model of Constitution, a Constitution is also defined as consisting
                of institutions and not of the paper that describe them. If it is true then the British Constitution has
                not been

                <a id="pageno">[pg:40]</a>

                theories or principles of government; but theories are suggested by experience.<br><br>

                Nonetheless, it is accepted that in a democratic state, the Constitution is the essential frame of a
                government which defines, prescribes and limits the rights, duties and functions of the chief organs of
                the state. It is the body of both doctrines and practices that form the fundamental organizing
                principles of a political state. In some cases, such as the United States, the Constitution is a
                specific written document; in others, such as the United Kingdom, it is a collection of documents,
                statutes, and traditional practices that are generally accepted as governing political matters. States
                that have a written Constitution may also have a body of traditional or customary practices that may or
                may not be considered to be of Constitutional standing. Virtually every state claims to have a
                Constitution, but not every government conducts itself in a consistently Constitutional manner. <input

                3.2.1 Constitution- the Living Organism<br><br>

                Some people perceive Constitution as a living organism. The rationale behind such perception is related
                to the essential ingredient of a good Constitution, the Constitution adaptable to the changing
                conditions of life. The well-known author of Constitution Bagehot says that the living Constitution- a
                Constitution that is in actual work and power.<input type="checkbox" id="fn3.41.24" /><label

                Constitution can be taken as an example of a living organism. In the USA Constitution twenty-seven
                amendments have been added since 1789. In addition to those mentioned above, other far-reaching
                amendments include the Sixteenth (1913), which allowed Congress to impose an income <a
                    id="pageno">[pg:41]</a>tax; the Seventeenth (1913), which provided for direct election of senators;
                the Nineteenth (1920), which mandated woman suffrage; and the Twenty sixth (1971), which granted
                suffrage to citizens 18 years of age and older. Thus, in more than two centuries of operation, the
                United States Constitution has proved itself a dynamic and living document. It has served as a model for
                other countries, its provisions being widely imitated in national Constitutions throughout the world.
                Although the Constitution's brevity and ambiguity have sometimes led to serious disputes about its
                meaning, they also have made it adaptable to changing historical circumstances and ensured its relevance
                in ages far removed from the one in which it was written.<input type="checkbox" id="fn3.42.25" /><label

                There are few basic prerequisites of a Constitution as a living organism:<input type="checkbox"

                &bull; Adaptability of the Constitution to all future and changing

                conditions is its fundamental virtue.

                A Constitution must possess dynamic force to survive the test of time.

                The court, being the real participant in the living stream of

                national life, applies the tenets of the Constitution to the changing

                conditions of life. The Constitution which is concise and less worded possesses larger scope for
                adaptation than one which is elaborate and

                prolific. A good judge possessing large vision and sound judicial mind is a greater asset to the nation
                for making the Constitution a living

                institution.

                In judicial review, adaptability of the Constitution is the guiding factor, and judicial review cannot
                be successful if the Constitutional judge takes a narrow and stinted view of the Constitution and fails
                to apply the Constitution to life.<br><br>

                3.2.2 The Effective Constitution that satisfies the principles of justice<br><br>

                According to John Rawls, people have to choose the most effective Constitution, the Constitution that
                satisfies the principles of justice and is best calculated to lead to just and effective legislation. To
                him, there are three such basic principles of justice, he calls them equality <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.43.27" /><label for="fn3.43.27"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br> 27 JOHN RAWLS, A
                    THEORY OF JUSTICE 199, Oxford University Press (1973)  <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> <br><br>

                The first principle of justice i.e. equal liberty is the primary standard for the Constitutional
                convention. Its main requirements are that the fundamental liberties of the person and liberty of
                conscience and freedom of thought be protected and that the political process as a whole be a just
                procedure. Thus, the Constitution establishes a secure common status of equal citizenship and realizes
                political justice <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.43.28" /><label for="fn3.43.28"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>  28 Ibid.  <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> <br><br>

                The second principle comes into play at the stage of the legislature. It dictates that social and
                economic policies be aimed at maximizing the long-term expectations of the least advantaged under
                conditions of fair equality of opportunity, subject to the equal liberties being maintained. At this
                point the full range of general economic and social facts is brought to bear. Thus, the priority of the
                first principle of justice to the second is reflected in the priority of the Constitutional convention
                to the legislative stage.  <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.43.29" /><label for="fn3.43.29"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>29 Ibid.  <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> <br><br>

                The last stage is that of the application of rules to particular cases by fudges and administrators, and
                the following rules by citizens generally. At this stage everyone has complete access to all the facts.
                No limits of knowledge remain since the full system of rules has now been adopted and applies to persons
                in virtue of their characteristics and circumstances.<br><br>

                3.2.3 Elements of a Constitutional Regime <br><br>

                The Constitutional regime has some sort of elements that should at least be satisfied by one
                Constitution. Some of the crucial elements of a constitutional regime include as follows:<input type="checkbox" id="fn3.44.30" /><label for="fn3.44.30"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>  30 CAVENDISH LAW CARDS, CONSTITUTIONAL LAW 222-224, Cavendish Publishing Limited, London- Sydney (1999).</span> <br><br> The authority to determine basic social policies should reside in a representative body selected/elected
                for limited terms by and ultimately accountable to the electorate.<br><br>

                &bull; In due course a firm majority of the electorate should be able to

                achieve its aims, by constitutional amendments if necessary. <br><br>

                &bull; All sane adults, with certain generally recognized exceptions, should have the right to take part
                in political affairs, and the precept one electorate one vote should be honoured as far as possible.
                <br><br>

                &bull; Elections should be fair and free, and regularly held. <br><br>

                &bull; There should be firm protections for certain liberties, particularly freedom of speech and
                assembly, and liberty to form political associations.<br><br>

                The principle of loyal opposition should be recognized, the clash of political beliefs, and of the
                interest and attitudes that are likely to influence them, are accepted as a normal condition of human
                life.<br><br>

                The Constitution must take steps to enhance the value of the equal rights of participation for all
                members of society.<br><br>

                It must underwrite a fair opportunity to take part in and to influence the political process..<br><br>



                <a id="pageno">[pg:44]</a>

                3.2.4 Purpose of Having a Constitution<br><br>

                The state is primarily divided into three institutional components; legislature to make laws; executive
                to implement and execute laws; and judiciary to interpret the laws and administer justice. In this
                fabric of a state mechanism, the Constitution deals with such questions as: how these organs structured,
                composed and organized? What are their powers and functions? What is the mutual relationship between
                these organs and between the people?<br><br>

                In order to carry out its activities and functions, whatever may be their range, it becomes necessary
                for any state to establish certain basic organs or agents or instrumentalities which act on its behalf
                and through which the state can function and operate. All the people in a state cannot combine and
                operate all together all the time to achieve the desired goals. For this, certain fundamental organs
                become necessary. This creates the need for Constitutional law to deal with that how these organs are to
                be established? How these organs are to function? What their powers are going to be? What is to be their
                mutual relationship with each other? And so forth. Thus, the purpose of having a Constitution will be to
                have a frame-work of government (fundamental or basic organs of state and government) which is likely to
                endure through the vicissitudes of a nation     <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.45.31" /><label for="fn3.45.31"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                features. It is noticeable that only the basic norms are inscribed in the Constitution. All and sundry
                rules are not brought into discussion under the fabric of Constitution.     <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.45.32" /><label for="fn3.45.32"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                3.3 The Concept of Fundamental Rights<br><br>

                Fundamental rights are distinguishing features of modern democratic values. Without fundamental rights,
                an individual can neither cultivate his best self nor help in the promotion of social good. The modern
                concept of fundamental rights owes its origin to human rights. Although both these terms apparently seem
                to have the same connotation, human rights are naturally inherent in human beings by virtue of their
                birth, whereas, the fundamental rights are correlated with the freedoms and rights which a man is
                entitled to by virtue of his association with the state as its citizens. They are more product of the

                The fundamental rights are the real basis of judicial review. The Constitution makers considered it
                necessary to recognize the right of judicial review in order to control the legislative actions of the
                state to take away the guaranteed rights without jurisdiction. Therefore, the fundamental rights are,
                for the purpose of judicial review, made justiciable and enforceable.<br><br>

                The fundamental rights are the conscience of the Constitution too. The insertion of fundamental rights
                in the Constitution is the result of constant struggle for freedom and fundamental rights. It is said
                that the guarantee of fundamental rights is the manifestations and recognition of the cravings of the
                people for the blessings of liberty and freedom. Inclusion of the fundamental rights in the Constitution
                also binds the legislature and executive.<br><br>

                The evolution of the concept of fundamental rights in Nepal is rather a delayed phenomenon. During the
                104-year long absolute dynastic rule of the Ranas, there was no scope for recognition of the rights of
                the Nepalese

                people. However, it is historical irony that the concept of fundamental rights in Nepal started with the
                promulgation of the Government of Nepal Act 1948, the first ever constitutional document of Nepal which
                was granted by none other than a Rana Prime Minster- Padma Shamsher. It is different matter that this
                Constitution could not be enforced.<br><br>

                It was only after Nepal's tryst with democracy in 1951 that the avenues for the realization of the
                fundamental freedoms and liberties of the Nepalese people could be opened. The promulgation of the
                Interim Government of Nepal Act, 1951 and the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1959, which can be
                treated as the Constitutional milestones in the political history of Nepal, marked important stages in
                the development of fundamental rights. However, the political coup staged by late King Mahendra put the
                evolution of fundamental rights in the reverse gear.<br><br>

                It took the Nepalese people thirty-years of constant struggle and countless sacrifices to dismantle the
                authoritarian Panchyat rule and restore democracy in Nepal through the historic people's revolution of
                1990. The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990, an outcome of the tripartite agreement between the
                King, Nepali Congress and the Leftist Alliance, is by far most democratic Constitution Nepal has ever
                had. It carries an elaborate and comprehensive statement of fundamental rights as well as the provision
                for the right to Constitutional remedies.<br><br>

                3.3.1 Relationship between Fundamental Rights and Directive

                Principles<br><br>

                Fundamental rights and directive principles, though apparently conflicting, are really complementary to
                each other if the golden rule is kept in view that not only should the greatest benefit to the largest
                number of people be the motivating factor of governmental activity, but it should also, at the same
                time, do the least harm to the smallest number of people.<a id="pageno">[pg:47]</a><br><br>



                The purpose of fundamental rights is to create an egalitarian society, to free all citizens from
                coercion or restriction by society and to make liberty available for all, whereas, the purpose of
                directive principles is to fix certain social and economic goals for immediate attainment by bringing
                about a non-violent social revolution. Through such a social revolution the Constitution seeks to
                fulfill the basic needs of the common men and to change the structure of the society, <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.48.37" /><label for="fn3.48.37"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>  34 Justice K.

                Fundamental rights and directive principles are not the brain child of any particular individual or
                group of individuals. They are mainly the product of history. They are the outcome of clash of ideas and
                ideals and social power <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.48.35" /><label for="fn3.48.35"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>   35 Id., at 22-23.<a
                href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> The philosophy underlying with fundamental rights and directive principles
                was evolved from the experience of momentous events of the world in general and Nepal in particular,
                during the last one century.<br><br>

                If there are any parts in the Constitution, in particular the Constitution of Nepal, which are
                transcendental and require a careful and imaginative approach and faithful adherence, they are parts 3 &
                4. They contain the philosophy of the Constitution vis a vis the conscience of the Constitution. They
                have their roots in the history of the last several decades. They are assigned an important place in our
                Constitution in the hope and expectation that in the near future the tree of true liberty would bear
                fruit in Nepal. They connect Nepal's future, present and past and give strength to the pursuit of the
                social revolution in our great and ancient land.<br><br>

                Directive principles of the state policy are the life giving provisions of the Constitution. These
                principles constitute the stuff of the Constitution and

                <a id="pageno">[pg:48]</a>

                its philosophy of social justice. These principles represent the pledges and the promises of the
                Constitution which is not merely a literary document but a living instrument.<br><br>

                The purpose of ideal governments is to ensure that there will be liberty, peace, justice and equality
                and brotherly love; that nation shall no more lift sword against nation and that the free development of
                each will lead to the free development of all. In the modern world, liberty is not, as is usually
                supposed, a single simple conception. It has four elements national, personal, political and
                economic.<br><br>

                Checks and counter-checks are necessary in every department of government, the executive, judiciary and
                legislative. In our Constitution we have such checks in the form of fundamental rights and we have also
                laid down guidelines for legislative and state action in the form of directive principles. It is obvious
                that an unreasonable interference with a fundamental right would be void; it is equally obvious that any
                state action or legislation which goes contrary to the directive principles should be
                ineffective.<br><br>

                It is said that government is the best which governs least. Under part 3, generally speaking, the state
                is asked not to do certain things. Under part 4, it is asked to do certain things. These dos and don'ts
                form an organic unit.<br><br>

                It shall be the duty of the state to follow the directive principles both in the matter of
                administration as well as in the making of laws. They embody the object of the state under the
                democratic Constitution, namely, that it is to be a welfare state and not a mere police state. Most of
                the directive principles aim at the establishment of economic and social democracy. Our Constitution
                through the embodiment of directive principles aims to establish a socialistic pattern of society not
                socialism. It is in that context the goal of the Nepalese polity is not laissez faire but a welfare
                state,

                <a id="pageno">[pg:49]</a>

                where the state has a positive duty to ensure to its citizens social and economic justice and dignity of
                the individual.<br><br>

                3.3.2 Conflict between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles<br><br>

                The question of priority in case of conflict between fundamental rights and directive principles has
                frequently been arisen in the Constitutional law. But while the fundamental rights are enforceable by
                the courts <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.50.36" /><label for="fn3.50.36"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>  36 See also THE CONSTITUTION OF KINGDOM OF NEPAL, art. 23 (1990). <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>

                 and the courts are bound to declare as void any law that is inconsistent with any of the
                fundamental rights, the directive principles are not so enforceable by the courts <input type="checkbox" id="fn3.50.37" /><label for="fn3.50.37"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br> 37 Id., at 24. <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>  and the courts cannot
                declare as void any law which is otherwise valid, on the ground that it contravenes any of the
                directives.<br><br>

                In the pattern of the Constitution, the fundamental rights guaranteeing the right to equality, the right
                to freedom, to property etc. have been supplemented with the directive principles of state policy. It is
                because a single political right of the citizen cannot ensure the all-round development of the citizen.
                Along with this, there should be a combination of social and economic rights too. The private benefit
                and public good, the personal right and the public well-being are, therefore, to be harmonized. The
                fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy are not derogatory of each other but are a
                correlation of the rights of person and his duties to the public. If the state can ensure the one, it
                should be conceded that it can also enforce the other. It is in this way alone that the Police state can
                be converted into a welfare state.<br><br>

                On the one hand, the Constitution has guaranteed the individual liberties and has elevated the
                fundamental rights to a Constitutional supremacy. On the other hand, it has edified the state into a
                welfare state. The citizen feels that the state primarily for the safeguard of his liberties and for the
                enforcement of his rights. The state, on the other hand, feels that the state

                <a id="pageno">[pg:50]</a>

                exists primarily to secure justice, justice not only in its isolated phenomenon of political justice,
                but justice in its all embracive form.<br><br>

                In this way there is always a debate giving a priority to what sort of right of the people. The citizen
                may demand the priority to political and civil right, but the state cannot minimize the other right or
                interest such as social and economic. At the same time the very preamble of the Constitution aspires to
                secure to the citizen, justice not only political, but also social and economic. The Constitution
                aspires to secure this justice in the concept that a man is to be given his due not only in the matter
                of security of freedom and liberty, but also in social and economic security. Justice, social and
                economy, undertakes to redeem mankind from hunger, ignorance and misery and from all forms of social
                evil and economic vice. It is recognition of the dignity of man and it seeks to afford provisions for
                the abundance and enrichment of his personality. Political justice based on the comprehension of civic
                and legal rights which constitute the political status of a citizen, can at once be recognized by a will
                incorporated, in the form of fundamental Rights in the Constitution. But the social and economic justice
                cannot be secured by documentary devices but has to wait until the state creates circumstances in its
                favor.<br><br>

                In determining the ambit of fundamental Rights, the court should not ignore the directive principles,
                but should adopt the principle of harmonious construction and should attempt to give affect to both as
                much as possible. This is the best demand and necessity of the present state. The court in India has
                transformed this necessity into a living reality. The decisions in Kerala Education Bills, C.B. Boarding
                and loading v. State of Mysore. 39, Minerva Mills v. India <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                examples.<br><br>

                <a id="pageno">[pg:51]</a>

                The court in Nepal has also attempted to make the harmonious relation between fundamental Rights and
                Directive principles of state policy. The Godabari Marble and Yogi Naraharinath cases are its examples.
                Nevertheless, this is not best held unless the state creates a number of administrative bodies and
                enacts laws in order to enforce them. In these circumstances there may be misunderstanding about the
                scope of powers and sometimes also a misuse of power.<br><br>

                3.4 The Concept of Judicial Review<br><br>

                The doctrine of judicial review, is, sometimes described as the doctrine of judicial supremacy in the
                interpretation of constitutional terms and principles. However, some jurists perceive judicial review as
                not the supremacy, but the judicial nationalism about all round progress of the society<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Schwartz a Constitution is naught but empty words if it cannot be enforced by the courts. It is judicial
                review that makes Constitutional provisions more than mere maxims of political morality. Judicial review
                provides the only adequate safeguard that has been invented against unconstitutional legislation. It is,
                in truth, the sine quonon of Constitutional structure/<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                The Indian author of judicial review of legislation Dr. Jhat writes in his preface that in a state where
                the constitutional supremacy prevails the Constitution can remain a living moral and intellectual force
                only by the system of judicial review. It is a main weapon of democracy, through the process of which

                process and regulating the social and economic structure of the society. The power of Judicial review
                writes another prominent Indian writer M.P. Jain has a vital significant to the concept of written
                Constitution. Independent Judiciary with the power of judicial review is one of the fundamental
                components of Constitutionalism. He further says there can in fact be no Constitution without judicial
                review <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Judicial review plays as least two prominent functions; legitimating the governmental action and
                protecting the Constitution against any undue encroach by the government. The notion of rule of law says
                Jeffrey Jowell and Down Oliver are enforced through judicial review+9. Justice of the Supreme Court of
                India Bhagwati delivering his speech on "Judicial Activism and PIL" stresses- a greater scope of

                judicial review is always directed against the despotism, and its sole objective is to protect the
                Constitution from the undue encroachment of the government and establish a just society <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Judicial review in a general speaking is simply defined as the process whereby the supreme judicial body
                of the state examines the decisions given by their inferior judicial body in order to establish whether
                or not they are under the process of due law. In the context of constitutional law, the term judicial
                review is, however, used differently. It has a wider as well as a narrower sense. In a wider sense, it
                is simply used to mean a final consideration and decision by a court of law that may be of dispute
                between private parties or between the private party and the state or a public authority. In a narrower
                and a technical sense it is used to mean a Constitutional provision of the state whereby a court of law

                review also conceive the system of judicial review as the process of judicial scrutiny of the
                legislative Acts on the touchstone of Constitutions. In this regard, judicial review may be of two
                kinds, namely, the judicial review of administrative actions, and the judicial review of legislative
                Acts.<br><br>

                Judicial review of administration is, in a sense, the heart of administrative law. It is certainly the
                most appropriate method of inquiring into the legal competence of a public authority. The aspects of an
                official decision or an administrative act that may be scrutinized by the judicial process are the
                competence of the public authority, the extent of a public authority's legal powers, the adequacy and
                fairness of the procedure, the evidence considered in arriving at the administrative decision and the
                motives underlying it, and the nature and scope of the discretionary power. An administrative act or
                decision can be invalidated on any of these grounds if the reviewing court or tribunal has a
                sufficiently wide jurisdiction. There is also the question of responsibility for damage caused by the
                public authority in the performance of its functions. Judicial review is less effective as a method of
                inquiring into the wisdom, expediency, or reasonableness of administrative acts, and courts and
                tribunals are unwilling to substitute their own decisions for that of the responsible authority.<br><br>

                5 Administrative actions can be classified into four categories, viz. <br><br> (1) rule- making action or quasi-
                legislative action, <br><br> (2) rule- decision action or quasi- judicial action, <br><br> (3) rule application action or
                administration, and <br><br>(4) ministerial action. <br><br> A legislative action has four characteristics, namely,
                generality, prospectively, public interest, and rights and obligations flow from it. (see, Union of
                India v. Cynamide India Ltd., (1987) 2 SCC 720.) Rule making action of the administration partakes all
                the characteristics of the legislative action, namely, generality, prospectively, and a behavior which
                bases action on policy consideration and gives a right or a disability.<br><br>

                <a id="pageno">[pg:54]</a>

                Judicial review of administration varies internationally. Sweden and France, for instance, have gone as
                far as subjecting the exercise of all discretionary powers, other than those relating to foreign affairs
                and defense, to judicial review and potential limitation. Elsewhere, a preoccupation with procedure
                results in judicial review deciding only whether the correct procedure was observed rather than
                examining the substance of the decision.<br><br>

                Judicial review cannot compel the state to act in a particular way because the courts concerned cannot
                impose sanctions on the government, which itself controls the use of force. Such remedies as an
                injunction, an order for specific performance, or an order for mandamus will not lie against the central
                government. These inhibitions, however, are of less practical importance than might be supposed.
                Nevertheless, nearly all governments (even revolutionary ones) are eager to proclaim the lawfulness of
                the regime and seldom disregard the decisions of an authorized court or tribunal. In judicial review of
                administration at a national level, a country's history, politics, and Constitutional theory all play
                their part. There are, broadly, three major systems: the common-law model; the French, or council of
                state, model; and the procurator model,<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                While exercising the power of judicial review of administrative actions it is the duty of the court to
                confine itself to the under mentioned questions: 56<br><br>

                whether a decision making authority exceeds its

                power?<br><br>

                whether the authority has committed an error of law?<br><br>

                whether the authority has committed a breach of the

                principles of natural justice?<br><br>

                whether the authority has reached a decision which no reasonable person would have reached?<br><br>

                55 See the Britannica op. cit.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:55]</a>

                  whether the authority has abused its power?<br><br>

                In this type of judicial review, the courts merely enquire whether the administrative authority has
                acted in accordance with law. Thus, review is different from appeal. In appeal, the appellate authority
                can go into the merits of the decision of the authority appealed against, whereas, in judicial review,
                the court does not go into the merits of the administrative action.57 The reasons behind not interfering
                the merits of the decision is that the administrative authorities are given powers by the statutes and
                such powers have to be exercised within the limits drawn by such statutes. As long as an authority acts
                within the ambit of the power given to it, no court should interfere. The basic principles of judicial
                review is that if an authority has power to decide, his decision ought not be interfered unless he has
                acted mala fide.58 Judicial review is a threshold enquiry regarding competence and intention.59 The
                Supreme Court of India in State of MP v. MV Vyavasayao has held that the power of judicial review of the
                court is not akin to appellate power. It is a supervisory power. While exercising this power, the court
                does not go into the merits of the decision taken by the authorities concerned but only ensure that the
                decision is arrived at in accordance with the procedure established by law and in accordance with the
                principles of natural justice. In addition to the compliance of the procedure established by law and the
                rules of natural justice, another ground of review may the error of jurisdiction.61 In this sense, the
                review court is concerned with two questions; <br><br>(a) whether the authority has exercised its power; and <br><br>(b)
                whether it has abused its power.<br><br>

                observed that-'one can conveniently classify under three heads the ground on which administrative action
                is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground he would call illegality, the second
                irrationality and the third procedural impropriety'. That is not to say that further development on a
                case by case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Discernibly, the judicial review can be exercised if the administrative action suffers from the vice of

                62 According to section 35 of the Indian Administrative Procedure Law administrative act is every
                direction, decision or other sovereign measure taken by an authority for the regulation of a particular
                case in the sphere of public law directed at immediate external legal consequences. A general order
                which addresses a category of persons who are determined or are determinable by common charactenstics or
                which concerns the public law quality of thing or its use by the general public. The law enjoins the
                requirements of form, contents, and procedure which an administrative act must comply Section 25 of the
                law imposes an obligation on the administrative authority to give information and advise as a helper to
                a citizen, and as such requires an administrative authority to advise a party about any statement or
                clarification, to correct any mistake in his application, or to ask for an application if it is missing.
                This is imperative in case a citizen due to his ignorance or mistake runs the nsk of being adversely
                affected in his rights during the course of any administrative proceedings.<br><br>

                Right of hearing is laid down in section 28(1) of the law which requires that before taking an
                administrative action which interferes in the rights of any party an opportunity be given to that party
                to express itself on the facts that are material for the decision. There is no instance of oral hearing.

                The broader classification of the grounds of judicial control of administrative discretion may be
                succinctly stated as excess of discretion and abuse of discretion. Excess of discretion may signify that
                when the administrative authority does something which it is clearly not authorized to do under the
                enabling law. Similarly abuse of discretion has been used for an unlawful purpose or its exercise is
                based on improper motives or bad faith or in its exercise irrelevant considerations have been taken into
                account. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                In course of time the principal grounds on which the judicial control of administrative action is

                67 The essence of this doctrine is that a person or a body acting under statutory power or authority can
                only do things which the statute authorizes him to do so and anything done beyond the power conferred in
                this behalf would be without jurisdiction and consequently the decision would be ultra vires. The
                doctrine is also applicable where the public body or

                <a id="pageno">[pg:58]</a>

                2. abuse of discretionary powers68<br><br>

                authority acting under the statute has committed any breach of any recognized principle developed by the
                courts which governs the exercise of discretionary power. Ultra inres may be of procedural and
                substantive. The principles of procedural and

                substantive ultra uires are applicable to subordinate legislation or the bye-laws. Procedural ultra
                vires means non-compliance with procedural requirements for making of any instrument etc. Subordinate
                legislation or the bye-laws may be ultra uires on the ground of non compliance with the mandatory
                procedural requirements for making of the instrument. Failure to comply with the mandatory procedural
                requirements have a direct bearing on the validity of the order and or the making of an instrument all
                procedural requirements laid down by the statute and of course to be compiled with in general. But it
                does not follow that in case of failure to follow such requirements strictly according to its letter
                will result the exercise of power being null and void. The statutes commonly prescribe procedures but
                they rarely make express provision as to the consequence that would follow because of non compliance and
                this area has been left for the courts to decide and the courts of law have adopted a flexible attitude
                in this matter.<br><br>

                6 Dicey was of the view that wide discretionary power was incompatible with the rule of law.
                Nevertheless, he accepted that for the rule of law, it was not that discretionary or sometimes wide
                discretionary power would be totally absent but the law should be able to control its exercise so that
                there may not be any abuse of discretion. It is in this context judicial review is available against the
                abuse of discretion.<br><br>

                Now-a-days the courts have laid down the principle- which requires the statutory power as to be
                exercised reasonably and in good faith and for proper and authorized purpose only and that, too, in
                accordance with the spint as well as letters of the empowering act. There is a principle that all
                discretionary powers must be exercised within certain parameters. The primary rule is that discretion
                should be used to promote the policies and objects of the governing Act. A discretionary power should
                not be used to achieve a purpose not contemplated by the Act that confers the power. All decisions
                makers are expected to act in good faith Powers must not be abused and should not be exercised
                arbitrarily of dishonestly (See Justice Bhagbati Prosad Banerjee and et al., op.cit., at 80.) In other
                words, it can be presented that there are other various rules\restrictions on discretion, which include:

                one should not act in bad faith;

                no discrimination could be made while exercising discretion between persons on the

                basis of irrelevant criteria;

                one should maintain independence and impartiality while exercising the discretion,

                etc <br><br>

                In order to prevent the abuse of discretion, the authority must take all relevant factors into account;
                exclude all irrelevant factors from its consideration; and reach the decision which is neither perverse
                nor irrational before reaching into any decision.<br><br>

                69 Error of law differs from error of fact. When an authority may wrongly interpret a word to which the
                legal meaning has attributed, it may be one form of error of law, whereas an error of fact is an error
                which the courts will be more reluctant to review. After all judicial review is available for errors of
                law but not on error of facts as the court in such case cannot seek any appeal and decide the
                correctness of the findings or correctness of the facts ascertained by the authority. The court is
                entitled only to correct the error of law. One of the rationales behind not permitting judicial review
                on error of fact might be that the courts will often not have the expertise to assess the factual
                situation, and may have great difficulty in deciding whether a factual error has resulted in a wrong
                decision. The courts have traditionally approached this matter by dividing error of fact into two
                categories. The first relates to reviewable errors of fact, which are jurisdictional, the other category
                is that of non- reviewable non- jurisdictional facts. (See Banerjee, op. cit. at 92) Error of law on the
                face of the record are corrected by writ of certiorari. It is the situation

                where the decision maker makes a decision wrong in law, and even if he was acting within

                the jurisdiction (intra vires).<br><br>

                <a id="pageno">[pg:60]</a>

                The judicial review of legislative enactment is, on the other hand, distinguished from that of actions
                of the executive or other authority so as the Constitutionality of an Act of the legislature and the
                Constitutionality of the action taken by the authorities charged with the duty of executing that law are
                two different matters. Judicial review of legislative enactment stands in a separate class by itself.
                This is a peculiar feature of Constitutions like that of the United States of America, India Nepal and
                so forth. There cannot be any judicial review of legislation, for instance, in a country like England
                where the parliament is supreme and it does not have any Constitutional fetters on the powers of
                legislation."<br><br>

                To All decisions are not justiciable before the court of law. There are some matters in relation to
                which the court because of the doctrine of separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary
                may be exceedingly reluctant to review. Matters such as exercise of prerogative powers and matters of
                high policy may be regarded as non- justiciable.<br><br>

                Prerogative power is separated into two categories those relating to foreign affairs, and those

                relating to domestic affairs (See Banerjee, op.cit. at 218).

                The foreign affairs, inter alia, are:

                power to make declaration of wars and peace;

                power to enter into treaty,

                recognition of foreign states;

                3.4.2 Grounds of Judicial Review of Legislative Acts

                In Nepal, Article 107 of the recently promulgated Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007 is a sole device of
                judicial control review of both legislative and administrative laws.

                Law made by parliament can be challenged on any of the following grounds:<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                justice.

                The law enacted without legislative competence on account of the violation of the rules of distribution
                of powers, or on account of the infringement of fundamental rights, or for the infringement of other
                constitutional restrictions which prohibit the legislature from enacting laws framed in the absence of
                legislative competence is still- born and void ab initio. Whereas the legislature has competence to
                enact a law, but the law is enacted in violation of some Constitutional restrictions, such law is not
                still- born and void ab initio, but is only unenforceable and if the prohibitions are removed the law
                becomes enforceable.<br><br>

                3.4.3 Judicial Review of Delegated Legislation<br><br>

                Delegated Legislation, in the modern age of democracy has so extensively institutionalized that it has
                become the part and parcel of the modern administrative process. It has been so vastly accepted by the
                modern welfare state that the doctrine of 'separation of power and delegatus non potest delegare have
                come to stay in a diluted form. But nevertheless, this

                significant development of the modern time, i.c., the legislative power of the administration is not
                absolute or unfettered free from control. To avoid the abuse or misuse of this delegated legislative
                power, the power is not minimized nor is it curtailed rather the compulsive necessity or desirability of
                delegated legislation is effectively promoted. It has now been generally accepted that in stead of
                objecting to the delegation of legislative power, it is better to concentrate on the control of the
                exercise of such delegated power through effective legislative and judicial supervision over the
                exercise of delegated legislation <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>73 An effective control mechanism minimizes the disadvantages and
                maximizes the benefits and advantages of the institution of delegated legislation.<br><br>

                There are several types of controls operating over delegated legislation, e.g., judicial control,
                legislative control and procedural control. They are the most effective controls in the entirety of
                control mechanism. This survey concentrates upon the judicial control over delegated legislation and is
                the theme of the study. Other controls are not taken into account. Since the judicial control over
                delegated legislation is deeply interlinked with the power of judicial review under the Constitution and
                the doctrine of ultra vires therefore, a brief account of the both concepts is required to be separately
                highlighted in distinct headings.<br><br>

                3.4.4 The Doctrine of Ultra Vires<br><br>

                The doctrine of ultra vires is the core of the judicial review of legislation as well as administrative
                action. The literal meaning of the phrase ultra vires is beyond the power. An Act which is for any
                reason in excess of power is ultra vires.74 It is the basic doctrine in Administrative Law and the
                foundation of judicial power to control actions of the administration.75 When the power is conferred on
                the administrative body, the instrument

                <a id="pageno">[pg:63]</a>

                conferring the power may itself provide for restrictions on the exercise of the power. If the
                administrative body goes beyond such restrictions imposed on it, in the exercise of power, it is treated
                ultra vires. The Supreme Court of India in Uttar Pradesh v. Renusagar Power Co. expressed, "If the
                exercise of power is in the nature of subordinate legislation, the exercise must conform to the
                provisions of the Statute. All the conditions of the Statute must be fulfilled." Yet in an another case,
                Greater Bombay Municipal Corp. v. Nagpal Printing Mills," the Court emphatically stated that delegated
                legislation repugnant to, or inconsistent with, or in contravention of, or in excess of, or overriding
                the provisions of the Parent Act is ultra vires.<br><br>

                The doctrine of ultra vires has two principal bases or aspects: substantive and procedural. If the
                legislation involves the defects of substance or if the exercise of any power will be limited by the
                substance of power i.e., what the authority is empowered to do, it is called substantive ultra vires. If
                the authority acts outside the substance of the power conferred, then it is, quite simply doing the
                wrong thing. This is the concept of substantive ultra vires. In the case of procedural ultra vires, an
                authority may be exercising a power for an authorized purpose but, if it falls to follow a required
                procedure, its actions will be open to challenge. The authority here may "doing right thing" but it is
                doing it "in the wrong way". This is the concept of procedural ultra vires. The doctrine of ultra vires
                is a key concept to be followed by the judiciary in the exercise of its extraordinary power. The nexus
                between the power of judicial review and the doctrine of ultra vires is inseparable and purposeful in
                connection with the judicial control over legislation and government action.<br><br>

                3.4.4.1 Substantive ultra vires<br><br>

                Circumstance as which lead to substantive ultra vires and are considered by the Supreme Court, are as
                follows:<br><br>

                3.4.4.1.1 Constitutionality of the Empowering Statute <br><br>

                If the empowering Statute is ultra vires the Constitution, legislation of any form, made under the
                authority of such Statute would also be void. Constitution prescribes the boundaries within which the
                legislature, through the Act is likely to act. If the Act itself exceeds the boundaries of the
                Constitution, the other sort of legislation framed hereunder will be ipso facto invalid, the enabling
                Statute may be unconstitutional if it goes beyond the express provisions of the Constitution, violates
                or breaches the fundamental rights of the citizen guaranteed under the Constitution. The
                Constitutionality of the enabling Statute can also be tested on the ground of excessive delegation as it
                is an implied. Constitutional limit on the enabling Statute laid down In re Delhi Laws Act,<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> 79 The limit
                is that essential powers of legislation cannot be delegated. The essential legislative power consists of
                determination or choice of legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule
                of conduct. The legislature, therefore, may not delegate its function of laying down legislative policy
                to an outside authority in respect of a measure and its formulation as a rule of conduct. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> 80<br><br>

                The Constitutionality of the enabling Statute is tested by the Supreme Court on grounds of the direct
                provisions of the Constitution, particularly on grounds of fundamental rights of Part 3 of the
                Constitution. The reason for this is that the Petitioners go to the Court for justice by contemplating;
                mainly the fundamental rights provisions of the Constitution. But

                <a id="pageno">[pg:65]</a>

                nevertheless, case like Bharatmani Jangam v. Parliamentary Secretariat, Singh Durbar is the examples in
                which the Court tested the Constitutionality of the provision of an Act, on ground of the independent
                provision of the Constitution, not related to fundamental rights.<br><br>

                In this case the Petitioner challenged Sec. 25 of the Act Relating to the Remuneration and Privileges of
                the Officials and Members of the Parliament, 2052 as it was inconsistent with Art. 67 of the
                Constitution. The contention of the Petitioner was that Sec 25 of the said Act had provided special
                allowance to the officers and members of the Parliament which was neither fixed nor directed by Art. 67
                of the Constitution. Art. 67 states that the remuneration and privileges of the Speaker and Deputy
                Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the National Assembly and
                members of Parliament shall be determined by law, and until so determined, shall be as specified by His
                Majesty. The Petitioner stressed that Art 67 empowers the concerned body i.e., the Parliament to frame
                laws for remuneration and privileges of the working or existing Parliamentarians and does not
                contemplate anything beyond that. It, therefore, does not empower the Parliament to make laws for
                special allowances of the ex-Parliamentarians who have turned into simple citizens after the expiry of
                their representation. The majority of the bench observed that Art. 67 is meant for the sitting
                Parliamentarians as it clearly says that remuneration and privileges of the Parliamentarians shall be
                determined by law, and until so determined, shall be as specified by His Majesty. The Court emphasized
                that the particular provision "until so determined shall be as specified by His Majesty" excludes the ex
                Parliamentarians, therefore, the impugned provision of the Act which provides special allowances to the
                ex-Parliamentarians throughout their whole lives, is in contravention of the Constitution. The Court
                stated that after the completion of the tenure of a particular post relating to a job no one is given
                any privileges except pension and gratuity and this is the accepted standard. Hence, the special
                allowance given to the

                NLR 2058 at 507.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:66]</a>

                Parliamentarians after the termination of the status of Parliamentarians is not in accordance with the
                Constitution. The Court expressed that to provide privilege to the Parliamentarians in the name of
                special allowances without the express provision of the Constitution, was also contrary to the principle
                of economic law. The Court made a clear-cut distinction between allowances and pension in this case and
                finally declared Sec. 25 of the Act Relating to the Remuneration and Privileges of the Officials and
                Members of Parliament void from the date of its decision by exercising Art. 88 (1) of the 1990
                Constitution.<br><br>

                However, J. Kedar Nath Upadhyaya dissented from the majority opinion and stated that the interpretation
                of any law requires observation of the whole arrangement of law in dispute. No interpretation is
                reasonable by casually taking a particular word or term into account. He expressed that there is no
                distinction between special allowances and pension as both terminologies carry the same meaning for
                providing allowances to the Parliamentarians after the completion of the tenure of Parliament specified
                by law. He further expressed that Art. 132 of the Constitution clearly defines remuneration and says,
                "Remuneration" means and includes salary, allowances, pension and any other forms of emoluments. Thus,
                he observed that under the concept of pension, allowances are evidently inherent for the persons who
                have previously served and have become free from service. The Court stated that the nature of pension
                given to the Parliamentarians is little different in comparison to the pension given to the civil
                servants, that is why, it is differently treated and given the name like "special allowance". He thus,
                did not agree with the view of the majority opinion, that "special allowances do not cover pension. He
                confirmed the Constitutionality of the impugned Sec 25 of the Act with Art. 67 of the Constitution and
                stated that it was quite intra-vires the Constitution. This decision is a landmark decision in the sense
                that it has adversely affected the interests of the Parliamentarians when they become ex-
                Parliamentarians and imposed a restriction on them so far as their supreme law making power is
                concerned.<br><br>

                In Advocate Chandra Kant Gyawali v.HMG Secretarial of the Council of Minister Singh Durbar is, the
                Petitioner challenged Clause (1) and (2) of Art. 9 of the Constitution on the ground of their
                inconsistency with Art 11 of the 1990 Constitution. The plea of the Petitioner was that clause (1) and
                (2) of Art 9 was discriminatory as they had provided the grounds for acquisition and termination of
                citizenship by providing sole importance to the father of a child and had totally ignored the very
                importance of the mother of a child. The Petitioner contended that it was a gross violation of the
                fundamental right to equality which guarantees the equality of all citizens before the law and does not
                discriminate between men and woman on grounds of religion, race, sex caste, tribe or ideological
                conviction or any of these.84<br><br>

                The Court held that it has the extraordinary jurisdiction under Art 88 (1) of the Constitution to test
                the Constitutionality of any law enacted by the legislature or by any other body under the delegation of
                legislative power, if a law imposes an unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of fundamental rights
                conferred by this Constitution, or on any other ground. The Court stated that by exercising such power
                of judicial review the Court can declare any law void, if it is inconsistent with the Constitution. The
                Court further stated that in the existing case it had no jurisdiction to see the Constitutionality of
                Art 9 (1), (2) on the ground of

                82 NLR 2058 at 615.

                83 Art 9 (1): A person who is born after the commencement of this Constitution and farther is a citizen
                of Nepal at the birth of a child shall be a citizen of Nepal by descent.

                Art 9 (2): Every child who is found within the kingdom of Nepal and the whereabouts of whose parents are
                not known shall, until the father of the child is traced, be deemed to be the citizen of Nepal by
                descent.<br><br>

                Art 11 (1): All citizens shall be equal before the law. No person shall be denied the equal protection
                of laws.<br><br>

                Art 11 (2): No discrimination shall be made against any citizen in the application of general laws on
                grounds of religion, race, sex, caste, tribe, or ideological conviction or any of these. Art 11 (3): The
                State shall not discriminate citizens among citizens on ground of religions, race, sex, caste, tribe, or
                ideological conviction or any of these

                <a id="pageno">[pg:68]</a>

                right to equality of a citizen guaranteed under Art. 11 of the Constitution. The Court explained the
                limits of its jurisdiction and emphatically stated that the Court has no power to see the
                Constitutionality of any Article on the ground of another Article of the Constitution as they carry the
                equal and independent status and importance. The Court thus highlighted the equal importance of the
                Articles in dispute and did not entertain the plea of the Petitioner by restricting itself within the
                Constitutional limit.<br><br>

                In Advocate Basundhara Thapa v. HMG, Council of Ministers, as the Petitioner challenged Proviso Clause
                of Sec. 7 (3) of the Schedule-tribe Schedule-caste (Adivasi Janjati) Development National Academy Act,
                2058 (2001), on the ground of its inconsistency with Art. 11(1), (2), and (3) of the Constitution. The
                Petitioner stated that the alleged Section was illogical, baseless and without measurement as it had
                made a clear-cut discrimination between men and women in the application of law on the ground of sex.
                The impugned provision of the Act had kept the woman in the de-gradational situation instead of
                protecting and advancing the same and thus had disrespected the Constitutional right to equality of the
                Petitioner guaranteed Art 11 (1), (2) and (3) of the Constitution. Sec.7 (3) of the Act had fixed the
                tenure of the nominated male member of the Managing Council for four years and there was the provision
                of denomination of the same. Not in conformity with this provision, Proviso to Sec 7 (3) had fixed the
                tenure of the nominated female member only for two years. In addition under the alleged provision, there
                was also a clear cut bar/restriction for not denominating the same. The Petitioner contended that it was
                a gross violation of the right to equality and requested before the apex judicial institution for its
                invalidation.<br><br>

                #5 NLR 2060 at 389.

                86 Proviso to Art. 11 contemplated the special provisions to be made by law for the protection and
                advancement of the interest of women, children, the aged or those who are physically or mentally
                incapacitated or those who belong to a class which is economically, socially or educationally backward.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:69]</a>

                The Court observed the alleged Proviso Clause of the Act evidently discriminatory as it had made a clear
                discrimination of tenure between the nominated members of equal status and put the female members in a
                degradation situation by imposing restriction through the fixation of tenure. The Court expressed that
                the impugned Clause had made the representative status of women in the secondary position and therefore,
                clearly discriminatory. The Court further emphasized the importance of the Universal Declaration of
                Human Rights, 1948, which has prohibited gender discrimination and Art 2 of the International Covenant
                on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), 1966 which has forbidden any type of discrimination against any
                person on grounds of race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion whatsoever and the
                UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), 1979, which has
                taken the objective of eliminating all types of discrimination between women and men and make them equal
                in every respect. Taking all these things into account, the Court, finally declared Proviso Clause of
                See 7 (3) of the said Act void as it was inconsistent with Art. 11 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of
                Nepal, 1990.<br><br>

                Whether the constitutionality of a bill can be tested by the Supreme Court under its power of judicial
                review or not, was clearly stated by the Supreme Court in Advocate Sitaram Agrawal v. HMG, Secretariat
                of the Council of Ministers. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>87 The Court expressed that only law; legislation or legal provision
                whatsoever may be the form, can be made the subject matter of judicial review under Clause (1) of Art 88
                of the Constitution. Except the subject-matter of law, other subject-matter cannot be tested by the
                Court to see its consistency or inconsistency with the Constitution or on any other ground. The Court
                reasoned that a bill is simply a draft of an Act tabled on or submitted to Parliament and therefore,
                cannot be treated as law. The Court further stated that a bill requires fulfilling or has to fulfill
                several procedural requirements to be a law. If it does not fulfill the

                87 NLR 2059 at 604.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:70]</a>

                procedural requirement, is not at all a law. it cannot be the subject-matter of the scrutiny of the
                Court under Art. 88 (1) of the Constitution. The court did not entertain the Writ Petition of the
                Petitioner and made a clear distinction between a bill and a law and excluded itself from testing the
                Constitutionality of a bill.<br><br>

                In Sirish Pathak v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the Petitioner challenged Sec. 12 of
                the Nepal Special Service Act, 2042. (1985) as unconstitutional. Sec. 12 of the Act provides that the
                Special Service Rules made under the authority of the Act are to be kept confidential and secrecy is to
                be maintained. The contention of the Writ Petitioner was that the alleged provision of the Act had
                contravened the Constitutional guaranteed right to freedom and right to information, guaranteed under
                Art. 12 and 16 of the Constitution respectively.<br><br>

                The Court stated that every arrangement for the sake of peace and security of a country is not likely to
                be published and made known to the every people. Though every citizen has the right to demand and
                receive information on any matter of public importance but the Proviso Clause of Art. 16 says that
                nothing in this Article shall compel any person to provide information on any matter about which secrecy
                is to be maintained by law. The Court further stated that the objective of the Special Service Act is
                related to the security management matters of the Country and Sec. 12 of the Act empowers the HMG to
                fulfill the objective of the Act, therefore, the mandate given by the Act to the concerned rulemaking
                body, not to publicly publish the rules, is not contrary to Art.16 of the Constitution. In this
                case, the Court emphasizes the very provision of the Parent Act so far as the publication of rule made
                under the authority of the Act is concerned. If there is the express provision under the Act which bars
                the publication of rules made there under for the sake of maintaining the secrecy, it is not in
                contravention of the rights to information. In this case, the Court rules out the publication of
                delegated legislation and

                concentrates upon the provision of the Act, whether publication is required under the enabling
                legislation or not for the proper information of the public at large.<br><br>

                In Advocate Mira Dhungava v. Secretariat of the Council of Ministers <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>89 the Petitioner challenged No. 12
                a of the Chapter relating to Inheritance of the Country Code (Muluki Ain) as it was in contravention of
                the Constitutional rights to equality guaranteed to the citizen of Nepal under Art. 11 of the
                Constitution. The impugned provision relating to inheritance had made the discrimination between the son
                and the daughter on the ground of the sex and had put the son in the privileged situation in comparison
                to the daughter. It had also made discrimination between an unmarried daughter and married daughter so
                far as the right to inheritance was concerned. According to the alleged provision, a daughter was liable
                to turn back the property achieved through the process of inheritance to her father's family if she was
                tied with the bond of marriage.<br><br>

                The Court observed that 'Share (through partition) and 'inheritance' are two distinct things and are
                likely to be treated distinctly. They are of different types so far as their legal arrangements, nature,
                purpose and procedures are concerned. They cannot be treated as the subject-matter of single concept and
                therefore, they cannot be assimilated on a single footing. The Court further stated that the property
                achieved through inheritance prior to marriage, if turned back to the original family after marriage,
                through a legal provision, is contrary to the provisions of convention treaty and agreement in which
                Nepal has remained a party and ratified the same for execution or implementation. The Court finally
                ruled that the alleged No. 12 a of the Chapter on Inheritance of the National code was against the
                accepted principles of human rights and in contravention of the right to equality guaranteed under Art.
                11 of the Constitution, as it had differently treated a son and a daughter in connection with the
                inheritance of property. The Court declared such provision ultra vires the

                89 NLR 2061 at 377.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:72]</a>

                right to equality from the date of its decision and discouraged the practice

                of gender discrimination.<br><br>

                In Sapana Pradhan Malla v. Secretariat of the Council of Ministers⁰ the Court highly concentrated upon
                the Constitutional provisions relating to rights to equality guaranteed under Art 11 and equated the
                same on grounds of international instruments which are approved and ratified by the Kingdom of Nepal.
                The Court emphatically stressed the importance of the international instruments and said that Nepalese
                law or any part there of inconsistent with the provision of a treaty, will be void and the provision of
                a treaty will prevail over the Nepalese law and such provision of the treaty will be applicable in Nepal
                like a part of Nepal law. The Court further expressed that since this arrangement is duly accepted by
                Nepal as democratic country, therefore, the gradual application of the matters relating to treaty,
                agreement, protocol or whatsoever, in which Nepal has been a party state and duly ratified the same,
                cannot be ignored in any

                way.<br><br>

                The Court, in this case, observed the necessary requirement of a committee of expertise to investigate
                into the subject-matter of laws relating to family matters and property rights and sees whether they are
                inconsistent with or contrary to, or in contravention of the provision of Art. 11 of the Constitution
                and treaty, or agreement or convention ratified by Nepal. The Court issued a directory order in the name
                of Prime Minister and the Office of Council of Ministers to form a committee of expertise by consulting
                the National Human Rights Commission, if possible, under the convernorship of the Secretary of the
                National Human Rights Commission, a representative of the Ministry of Women, Children and the Social
                Welfare, having the knowledge of the subject-matter in question, a representative of the Ministry of Law
                and Justice, having the knowledge of the concerned subject-matter, a sociologist and a representative of
                the social organization relating women, to exhaustively see the provisions of

                law relating to family and property rights raised by the Petitioner and provide a concrete solution of
                the same.

                In Navraj Budhathoki v. HMG Council of Ministers Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the Petitioner
                challenged Sec. 9 (2) of the Police Act, 2012 (1955) and R. 98 (1) of the Police Rules, 2049 (1992) as
                they were inconsistent with Arts 11, 12 (2) (e) and 124 of the Constitution. Sec 9 (2) of the Police Act
                states that the police personnel shall remain in job as per the choice of the HMG. The Act, itself, does
                not fix the tenure of the police personnel. Sec. 39 of the police Act empowers the HMG to frame rules to
                fulfill the objectives of the Act. Accordingly, under the delegation of legislative power, Rule 98 (1)
                of the Police Rules fixes thirty year tenure of the police personnel, for retirement. Art 124 of the
                Constitution refers to the Constitution of civil service and reads that His Majesty's Government may, in
                order run the administration of the country constitute service as may be required. The Constitution
                operation and condition of service thereof shall be determined by an Act. Art. 11 of the Constitution
                guarantees the rights to equality of all citizens and states that all citizens shall be equal before the
                law and no person shall be denied the equal protection of laws. Art. 12 (2)(e) guarantees the right to
                freedom of all citizen and includes freedom to practice any profession or to carry on any

                occupation, industry or trade.<br><br>

                The Petitioner contended that Art. 124 was the basic source of the Police Act like the Civil Service Act.
                The plea of the Petitioner was that the Police Act was made under Art 124 of the Constitution;
                therefore, the conditions of service of the Police were likely to be the same as the civil servants of
                the country. Since Sec 9 (2) of the Police Act had stated that the Police personnel would remain in job
                as per the choice of the HMG, therefore, this provision was a sort of unrestricted provision, therefore
                in contravention of Art 11 and Art 124, of the Constitution.<br><br>

                91 NLR 2060 at 37.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:74]</a>

                The Court observed that the police service and the civil service cannot be equated on the same footing
                as the Police service does not owe its authority from Art. 124. Art. 124 prescribes only the conditions of
                service of the civil servants, therefore the conditions of the service of the police personnel fixed
                under the Police Rules, 2049 (1992), under the delegation of legislative power, delegated by the Police
                Act., under Sec 39 of the Act, to execute the objective of the Act was not in contravention of Art. 124
                of the Constitution. The Court observed that the conditions of services of two distinct and the separate
                services of different nature cannot be treated as the same and therefore, it is quite unreasonable and
                illogical to treat them equal on equal footing. The Court, thus asserted for the provisions of Police
                Rules which had fixed a thirty year of service period for the retirement of the police personnel and
                stated that the alleged provision was not in contravention of Art 11, Art 12 (2) (e) and Art 124 of the
                Constitution. The Court thus rejected the Writ Petition of the Petitioner.<br><br>

                In advocate Durga Bahadur Ghale and others v. PM Surya Bahadur Thapa, Office of the PM and Council of
                Ministers,<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span> 92 the apex Court ruled that it is the duty of the Petitioner to show and prove how any Act or
                Rule is inconsistent with the Constitution. The Court always presumes in favor of the Constitutionality
                of any law. There is a general judicial presumption that Acts and Rules are valid and intra vires and
                the burden of providing the unconstitutionality of any law or legal provision lies on the claimant or
                petitioner. The Court stated that the liberalization of locus standi under Art.88 (1) does not mean that
                the burden of proof, whether any Act or Rule is inconsistent with the Constitution is transferred to the
                HMG or the Parliament. The Court further stated that in the countries like USA and India there are
                several measures which are accepted in context of judicial review of legislation. Basically the Court
                under its self-imposed limitation, necessarily entertains the locus standi of the Petitioner as a
                Petitioner must have the standing, but it is the Petitioner who has to prove with the

                92 SC. Bulletin 2061 at 3.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:75]</a>

                adequate pleading the inconsistency of laws with the Constitution. Thus, the Court in this case,
                highlighted the universally accepted principles of the judicial review of legislation.<br><br>

                In Raghu Mainali v. HMG, Council of Ministers, Singh Durbar, Secretariat the Court. once again, ruled
                that any law can be declared void only when the law in dispute is directly and clearly inconsistent with
                the Constitution. The Court said that it is the sole responsibility of the Challengers who challenge the
                law on the ground of its inconsistency, to evidently show how the law in question is inconsistent with a
                particular provision of the Constitution and what are the grounds of its inconsistency.<br><br>

                In Ramhari Pandey v. HMG, Ministry of Physical Planning and Construction, the apex Court once again
                expressed that it is not the duty of the Court to see on its own the Constitutionality of the legal
                enactment and find out the causes of the same, drafted through the exercise of legislative will rather
                it is the responsibility of the Petitioner to find out and establish the grounds and causes of
                unconstitutionality of a particular enactment. Therefore, if someone (he/she) knocks the door of the
                Court for the invalidation of any law, the Court under Art 88 (1) of the Constitution observes the
                transparent criteria raised by the Petitioner and thereafter takes a concrete decision for the
                validation or invalidation of

                law.<br><br>

                3.4.5 Rules for Determining the Constitutionality of Legislation

                The tests for the determent of the Constitutionality of a statutory provision are at least three. The
                first is, whether the statute in question has gone beyond the legislative competence of the legislature
                which passed it. And, for the purpose of the application of this test, the scheme of the

                93 NLR 2059 at 741.

                4NLR 2059 at 300.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:76]</a>

                distribution of legislative powers is to be perused and the scope of the particular legislative entry as
                the parent of the law in question is to be ascertained and interpreted <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>95<br><br>

                The second is whether the legislature in passing a statute has discharged its essential legislative
                functions. The essential legislative functions consist in the formulation of a policy and having it down
                into a binding rule of conduct. If no principle or policy is ascertainable from the statute, it is
                liable to be struck down out of hand. But, it has its other facet also. A statute may formulate the
                policy into a binding code of conduct and may also indicate the persons or things to whom such policy is
                intended to apply. However, sometimes a statute may not make a classification of the persons or things
                for the purpose of applying its provisions but may leave it to the discretion of the executive to select
                and classify the persons or things to which its provisions are intended to apply. In such a case it will
                further be necessary for the statute in question to lay down a standard or principle for guidance in the
                matter of exercise of discretion by the executive as regards that selection or classification. But when
                the statute does not lay down such standard or such principle for the guidance of the executive, but
                leaves the matter of selection or classification of the persons or things intended to be subject to the
                provisions of a statute, to the arbitrary will of the executive, the state shall be unconstitutional for
                excessive delegation of powers to the executive 96<br><br>

                The third test is, whether the classification of such persons or things as appear on the face of the
                statute, or the standard prescribed for the guidance of the executive for making such classification is
                or can reasonably be regarded as based upon some differentia which distinguish such persons or things
                grouped together from those left out of the group and whether such differential have reasonable relation
                to the object sought to be achieved by the statute and whether the provisions of a

                Ibid.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:77]</a>

                statute which curtails the liberties of a subject or imposes burdens or obligations upon him are within
                the restrictions Constitutionally permissible to be imposed upon the exercise of a right of the
                individual. If the statute satisfies these tests, it can be upheld as valid and Constitutional but if it
                does not satisfy these tests, it will be unconstitutional. It is this third test which sums up the
                fundamental rights of the subject.<br><br>

                3.4.6 The System of Judicial Remedies<br><br>

                The judicial remedies may be roughly divided into two families- namely, the family of ordinary private
                law remedies, such as damages, injunction and declaration, and the family of public law remedies,
                principally certiorari, prohibition and mandamus collectively known as the prerogative remedies. The
                ordering of certiorari, mandamus and prohibition-the three prerogative orders is always discretionary.
                The judicial safeguards in administrative proceedings are certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo-
                warranto and habeas corpus. There is sometimes also a third family of special statutory
                remedies.<br><br>

                A system of judicial remedies for the supervision of administrative action should strive for three
                objectives: comprehensiveness, simplicity, and predictability. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>97 It is derived from two main sources.
                There are, first, a group of statutes which establish an agency and incorporate provisions for the
                review of its actions. There is, second, a brace of remedies which have developed by the combined action
                of the common law and statutes consolidating, simplifying, or in some other way reforming the common law
                remedies. These remedies are certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, habeas corpus, quo-warranto (the

                Judicial review relates to the granting of the prerogatives orders of certiorari, mandamus and
                prohibition. These prerogatives powers were historically used by the Council of the King (in England) to
                supervise the work of justices of the peace who had both judicial and administrative responsibilities
                within localities. With the growth of the administrative state these supervisory powers, which were now
                in the hands of judges of the Queens Bench Division, started to acquire ever-increasing

                importance, <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                issuing one or more of the three prerogatives orders-namely, certiorari, mandamus and prohibition. An
                order of certiorari quashed a decision of an inferior tribunal, mandamus compelled an inferior tribunal
                to carry out its duties, and prohibition prevented an inferior tribunal acting unlawfully

                or in excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>

                Availability: certiorari and mandamus are the two most serviceable of the common law remedies.
                Certiorari is more or less the progenitor of the modern statutory review. According to the usually
                stated formula, certiorari lies to review judicial or qui-judicial action. 102 Ordinarily it was used to
                review the actions of lesser judicial officers, but there are very early instances of its being directed
                to tax levies by drainage or sewer commissioners, action which would today be classified as legislative
                103 In the earlier time, certiorari was limited only to the judicial actions.104 Some later English and
                American cases, however, have created refined distinctions between judicial on the one hand and
                administrative or legislative on the other, thus somewhat impairing the availability of the writ. 105 In
                the Cardiffe Bridge case (K. B. 1700) the court said: whenever any new jurisdiction is erected, be it by
                private or public act of parliament, they are subject to the inspections of this court by writ of error,
                or by

                certiorari and mandamus. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                10 Id., at 167: Certiorari, as it finally developed in the English system, was limited to jurisdictional
                error. It did not and does not now in England reach a mere error of law unless it appears on the face of
                the record. But for the most part the American common law, if it ever accepted so limited an office for
                the writ, outgrew the limitation in the 19th century. A remnant of the limitation is, however, preserved
                for example, in Pennsyvania supreme court which has a broad certiorari and a narrow certiorari ie.
                certiorari to test jurisdiction and procedural regularity is derived from the Constitution and cannot be

                Though in the state systems certiorari is of great value, its serviceability has unfortunately been
                somewhat impaired by questionable distinctions. Many of the courts hold that it is not enough that the
                administrative action is based upon a required hearing and is thus judicial in manner. The action must
                also be judicial in its nature. It must not be legislative or administrative, these sometimes being
                thought of as different, sometimes as synonymous. The New York courts, for example, developed quite
                early the theory that certiorari does not lie to review legislative action of inferior tribunals. The
                case which seems first to have introduced this theory of writ is Matter of Mount Morris Square. (2 Hill
                14 (N. Y. 1841)107 In this case, there was in question an ordinance of the City of New York providing
                for the opening of a square, for condemnation of the necessity land, and for assessing the land
                benefited. The court held that this act was not judicial and that its legality could not be called in
                question on a writ of certiorari. The rule of this case is now firmly established, 108 and is followed
                in a number of states. The history of this restriction on certiorari and the manner in which it is
                applied seems to indicate that it is in part a device for excluding review prematurely; thus the court
                probably considers that it is inadvisable to hold up an entire improvement scheme before its burden is
                felt by a specific individual. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Contrary to the verdict held by the New York courts, in New Jersey the courts declared that certiorari
                was available for legislative as well as judicial action, and explicitly rejected the New York doctrine.
                In South View Cemetery Assn v. Hailey (1945) it was held that administrative action review able by
                mandamus is one where investigation, if any is ex parte or voluntary, a quasi-judicial action review
                able by certiorari is one in which all parties are entitled to a hearing. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                The doctrine of some courts that certiorari does not lie to review an administrative as opposed to a
                judicial act has created considerable misunderstanding and confusion and perhaps some injustice.<br><br>

                One is led to conclude that at the present time certiorari has more or less worked itself clear of most
                of the complicating limitations which have at one time or another been attached to it. The distinction
                between legislative and judicial still obtains in a number of jurisdictions. But for all practical
                purposes certiorari is available to review a proceeding inter partes where decision is to be taken on a
                record made at a hearing required by law. 114<br><br>

                3.4.6.1.1 Record and Scope of Review

                Certiorari, as it functions today, reaches all questions of legality and the sufficiency of the
                evidence. In the English and the American practice the only questions for review, as stated above, had
                been the jurisdiction of the agency and such errors of law as happened to appear on its face of the

                111 See, Fischer v. Bedminster Township, 5 N. J. 534, 76 A. 2d 673 (1950) quoted by Louis at 170 (in New
                York, for example, certiorari is the ordinary remedy for reviewing a rate order, but it does not permit
                an independent judicial finding... this technical inflexibility of certiorari seems both unfortunate and
                unnecessary. (See Jaffe, op. cit. at 175-176)<br><br>

                record. Today, certiorari can be issued to quash the administrative, judicial as well as legislative
                actions\decisions on any of the following grounds: 115 lack of jurisdiction: if the authority commits an
                error in its decision on jurisdictional facts and thereby assumes jurisdiction which never belongs to
                it; if the authority is incompetent to take action in respect of a locality, party or subject matter; if
                the law which gives jurisdiction is itself unconstitutional; if preliminary essentials have been
                disregarded i.e. omission to serve notice as required by

                law.<br><br>

                excess of jurisdiction: where the authority has jurisdiction but it exceeds its permitted limits. abuse
                of jurisdiction: where the authority has jurisdiction but has abused it inasmuch as it exercises its
                power for an improper purpose, or on extraneous consideration, or in bad faith, or leaves out a relevant
                consideration, or does not exercise the power by itself but at the instance and dictation or direction
                of someone else.<br><br>

                violation of the principles of natural justice: viz. rule

                against bias, and the rule of audi alteram partem. error of law apparent on the face of the record: the
                document in which the determination is recorded; documents which indicate the proceedings and pleadings;
                report, the extracts of which are included in the record; documents which are mentioned in the formal
                order to be the basis of the decision. fraud: it operates to take away jurisdiction and results in

                the denial of justice.<br><br>

                <a id="pageno">[pg:83]</a>

                3.4.6.2 Prohibition

                The order of prohibition is the reverse of mandamus. It prevents authority acting or continuing to act
                in excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>

                Prohibition prevents the administrative bodies agencies\authorities from continuing their proceedings in
                excess or abuse of their jurisdiction or in violation of the principles of natural justice or
                infringement of the fundamental rights or fraud or in contravention of the law of the land. It is a writ
                of right and can be issued in anticipation of any of the grounds mentioned above in certiorari. The only
                fundamental differences between the two is that certiorari is issued when the administrative authority
                has already determined the action and handed down the decision; whereas prohibition is issued when the
                proceedings are in progress to forbid or prohibit the administrative authority\body\agency from
                continuing the

                proceedings, <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                3.4.6.3 Mandamus

                Mandamus¹18 and certiorari are the twin pillars of the common law of judicial control. Though the scope
                of each may be stated independently, in their modern development, at least, they intermesh and together
                cover a good part of the ground of judicial review. Mandamus in its most usual definition commands an
                officer to perform a duty which he has refused to perform.119 In modern practice, mandamus is often used
                to review final action of an affirmative character which for one reason or another cannot be reviewed by
                certiorari or statutory appeal. 120 It is also often said that mandamus is not available unless there is
                no other adequate remedy at

                117 See Bhatia, op.cit., at 142. If we see the history of mandamus, it was held in Kendall v. United
                States (1838) that

                the courts of the District of Columbia did have the mandamus power.<br><br>

                law as, for example, statutory appeal or certiorari. Provided, in Rex u. Barkeria Lord Mansfield said of
                the writ: it was introduced to prevent disorder from a failure and defect of the police. Therefore, it
                ought to be used for all occasions when the law has established no specific remedy. and where in justice
                and good government there ought to be one.<br><br>

                Historically, mandamus was one of the prerogative writs. The writ began to develop first under Coke at a
                time when the common law courts interpreted the age-old actions against the King's officers as deriving
                from a power in the courts to guarantee the rule of law, 122 The King, through his judges of the King's
                Bench, exercised a supervisory jurisdiction over his officials. But one view of the American theory of
                separation of powers it may be argued that since the executive, the legislature and the judiciary are
                coordinate, neither can command the other.<br><br>

                There are at two schools of thoughts in this regard. The first being the pronouncement of Justice
                Marshall in the Marbury v. Madison which deals with the characteristics of the writ of mandamus and
                perhaps the first case in which the writ of mandamus was applied for the first time in the
                Constitutional jurisprudence. In this case Marshall held that whenever an officer is directed by law to
                do a certain act affecting the absolute right of individual, the officer may be directed to act.
                Marshall was, however, careful to point out that the judges would not compel the exercise of functions
                which are in political in nature. The second being the pronouncements held in Kendall v. United
                States123 and Decatur v. Paulding, 124 In these cases the Taney Court was much more guarded. The
                majority in the Kendall case ordered the postmaster to settle an account because it was a mere
                ministerial act, but it spoke at great length about the separation of powers. It concluded that mandamus
                could be issued

                only where Congress had conferred on an officer a limited power not subject to presidential control; and
                Taney led a dissent not disagreeing with this holding but bases on the proposition that the courts of
                the District of Columbia did not in the absence of Congressional grant have the mandamus power since
                they did not, as did the King's Bench, represent the royal prerogative.<br><br>

                Mandamus and certiorari are often public proceedings brought by a citizen rather than an injured person.
                The public character of mandamus is manifested by the notion that mandamus is discretionary, that it can
                be refused where injury to the public from its grant would outweigh its value as a remedy for the
                plaintiff 125 In mandamus, as in certiorari, there are certain prime obstacles to success. In
                certiorari, as said above, some of the judges are obsessed with the question, whether the action below
                is judicial or administrative. In mandamus it is said that the remedy lies only where the action to be
                commanded is ministerial or involves no element of discretion. Another form of this idea is that the
                court can command the officer only if there is a clear legal duty, 126 According to this notion
                administrative act can be classified a priori either as ministerial or discretionary, and the writ of
                mandamus cannot be issued in case the action is discretionary rather than ministerial one. However this
                notion of mandamus seems unsound and unworkable in the present context. The fact that there may be
                discretionary elements present does not, or at least should not, exclude judicial review, whether by
                mandamus or other appropriate remedy, where legality irrelevant or forbidden considerations have
                determined the decision. 127 The court can decide what relevant discretion has been granted. The crucial
                test of this might be that whether there is abuse of power. In another form of idea it can be said that

                law. This means that he may make a choice which the court might not itself have made as an original
                proposition. But if a court is convinced that the rule chosen by the officer is clearly contrary (in its
                opinion) to the statutory purpose, then it will order the officer to act according to its view of the
                law; it will not and should not desist merely because in a general sense the officer has discretion. He
                has exercised his discretion contrary to law and in this sense he has violated a clear duty, <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>

                Mandamus is used to compel the authority to carry out its duties. The scope of mandamus, however, fairly
                limited. It is appropriate where jurisdiction is wrongly refused, but not where the authority accepts
                jurisdiction and then allegedly makes a mistake in the exercise of that jurisdiction. <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>129 In brief,
                mandamus may be used to compel proper consideration of whether to exercise a discretionary power, but
                not, generally speaking to compel the actual exercise of it.<br><br>

                No mandamus will lie in purely discretionary matters duties. An authority, roughly speaking, may bear
                two types of duties, namely, the duties which involve or require the exercise of some degree of official
                discretion, other the duties where the officer is vested with no discretion. Thus, mandamus is not lie,
                either to control the exercise of that discretion or to determine upon the discretion which shall be
                finally given. Nevertheless, every discretionary power vested in the executive should be exercised in a
                just, reasonable and fair way. That is the essence of the rule

                of law.<br><br>

                Court cannot issue a writ in the nature of mandamus to the government to bring a statute or statutory
                provisions into force when according to the statute the date on which it should be brought into force is
                left to the discretion of government.<br><br>

                3.4.6.3.1 The Scope of Review

                It would not be easy to draft or apply a single formula in regard to the scope of review under mandamus.
                The courts seem intuitively to have sensed this. They have responded variously from situation to
                situation rather than by evolving a coherent formula. However, there are certain rules of scope
                established in the due course of courts practices which

                include as follows:

                . The determination of the right of right bearers; and . The determination of the reasonability of duty
                bearers

                Mandamus is a command or an order to any Constitutional, statutory or a non- statutory body agency
                authority to do or to forbear or to refrain from doing some specific act which such
                body\agency\authority is obliged to do or refrain from doing such act under the est lex, and the act is
                in the nature of a public duty or statutory duty or ministerial act. The ground for the grant of
                mandamus is the same on which certiorari and prohibition can be issued. However, the conditions for the
                issuance of mandamus

                are:130<br><br>

                There must be public or common law duty viz duty which is public in nature created either by a statute,
                the Constitution, or by some rule of common law. 131 A duty private in nature and arising out of a
                contract was not enforceable.<input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>122 Now, recently the mandamus has been issued for the specific performance
                of a contract to advance money, 133 Public duty includes the

                performance of ministerial duty and mandamus shall be issued if there is non- performance of ministerial
                duty. There must be a specific demand for the fulfillment of duty and there must be specific refusal by
                the administrative

                authority body\agency, tas

                . There must be a clear right to compel the performance of some duty cast on the authority, 136<br><br>

                Similarly, the purpose of issuing the writ of mandamus may as follows: To enforce the performance of a
                statutory duty where a

                To enforce the fundamental rights;

                public officer is obliged to perform under the law or

                Constitution;

                To compel any person to perform his public duty where the duty is imposed by the Constitution or a
                statute or

                statutory instrument;

                To compel a court or judicial tribunal to exercise its

                jurisdiction when it has refused to exercise it;

                To direct a public official or the government not to

                enforce a law which is unconstitutional.

                The mandamus is not generally issued against the head of the state which is titular and against a
                private individual or body.

                It protects a citizen from being deprived of a public office to which he has a right. It also cares to
                entertain pro bono publico because they are interested that right persons occupy public office, 139 The
                conditions for the

                issuance of quo-warranto are: <input type="checkbox" id="fn" /><label for="fn"><sup></sup></label><span><br><br>
                    <a
                    href="" target="_blank"></a><br><br></span>140 Office must be a public office.<br><br>

                Public office must be substantive in nature, viz, office which is permanent in character and is not
                terminable at will. The person must be in actual possession of the public office.

                The public office must be held in contravention of law.<br><br>

                The fundamental basis of the proceeding of quo-warranto is that the public has an interest to see that
                an unlawful claimant does not usurp a public office. It is, however, a discretionary remedy which the
                court may grant or refuse according to the facts and circumstances of each case. A writ of quo-warranto
                may, thus, be refused where it is vexatious or where it would be futile in its result or where a
                petitioner is guilty of laches or where there is an alternative remedy for ousting the usurper. Quo
                warranto is thus a very powerful instrument for safeguarding against the usurpation of public offices.

                3.4.7 Appropriateness of the System of Judicial Review

                The statements of the appropriateness of the system of judicial review may

                be as follows:

                According to the strict doctrine of separation of powers, each power must If so, legislation is the
                exclusive function of the legislature, and it should have a separate area of action. The other power
                should not encroach on it. be left alone to decide whether its legislation accords with the
                Constitution. But this cannot work satisfactory. It is because the authors of the legislation can be
                biased in favor of its validity as they are involved in it they cannot see it from outside. So, there
                must be such a body of the

                in Quoted in Bhatia, op. cit., at 143. MAD. M. Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla, AIR 1976 SC 1276.

                Basu, op. cit., at 127


                <a id="pageno">[pg:91]</a>

                state that could see the legislation conforms to the Constitutional requirements or not. That body is
                judiciary, which is assumed a separate and impartial organ of the state. 145<br><br>

                The settlement of an issue of the Constitutionality of a statute may be entrusted only by a
                professionally trained body of lawyers and judges. The legislature and the executive may not be expected
                to perform it.<br><br>

                The two departments of the state, namely, the executive and the gislature are accountable to the people,
                as the representatives of them. So, the two departments of the state are assumed to be biased to the
                subjects. But the next department of the state viz. the judiciary is not accountable to any particular
                subject, as the members of it, are not elected, and expected to be independent an impartial. 146<br><br>

                -The very objective of guaranteeing human rights is to preserve against legislation and not merely
                against the administrative action, which is

                possible only by the judiciary.<br><br>

                The judiciary is regarded as the guardian of the Constitution because other two departments of the
                state, namely, the executive and the legislature, being political in nature, do perform the political
                tasks and sometimes overlap their limitations as drown by the Constitution. But the judiciary being a
                non-political body can supervise and scrutinize the

                actions of the two agencies.<br><br>

                According to Prof. Holdsworth 147 all persons who draw their salaries from the public revenue are in the
                service of the state. Judges are not govemment servant in the sense that the civil servants are bound to
                obey

                interpret the law

                the orders of the government. The Judges are totally independent to

                In this way the judiciary a as compared to other major agencies of the state least dangerous agency that
                can only protect and preserve the fundamental rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution and even
                the Constitution itself from the undue encroachment of such other agencies of

                the state.<br><br>

                3.4.8 Aims and Need of Judicial Review

                Judicial review is the process applied by the court to determine the Constitutionality of legislative
                Act, ordinance or custom having the force of law if enacted or having come into existence against the
                Constitutional directions, intentions, prohibitions and limitations. The court has power to declare such
                law, ordinance or custom void and to refuse its enforcement. The judicial review aims at not reviewing
                the decision of the administrative authority or how a particular person has been appointed to act as an
                authority, but of the decision-making process of the administrative authority thus violating the
                fundamental rights of persons, and as such the supreme court has no power in its discretion to refuse
                appropriate remedy if violation of fundamental right is proved. The 148 merits of government decisions
                are not the concern of judicial review. 149 In this connection, the fundamental aims of judicial review
                can be listed

                as follows;<br><br>

                To assure the protection of rights, avoidance of their violations socio-economic uplifts and to alert
                the legislature to be in

                conformity with the Constitution,

                <a id="pageno">[pg:93]</a>

                To enforce the Constitution by declaring legislative Acts violating the Constitutional mandates null and
                void, . To create just and valid social order and having invalidated the unjust, bad and
                unconstitutional lawso . To infuse life in the dry and abstract bones of the Articles of the
                Constitution enabling it to be a living organism so as to satisfy

                the needs of the time151

                To exert a great moral force upon the legislature to keep it within the limits of the Constitution and
                to save the people from

                the democratic tyranny.

                Despite of this, the need of judicial review may be justified as to establish democratic and
                Constitutional balance; to uphold the supremacy of the Constitution; to evolve judicial legislation; to
                save legislature from its legislative power being encroached upon by the executive; and to check the
                legislature from delegating its essential legislative function to the executive and from infringing
                fundamental rights guaranteed to the

                citizen.

                Thus, the need for conferring the special jurisdiction of judicial review, on the judiciary, is to
                control such devices of the state so as to protect and reconcile not only political right but also to
                social and economic rights of the people and to make attempt enforcing the directive principles of state

                policy.

                3.4.9 The Nature and Classification of Law

                For the purpose judicial Review, the law can be classified as Constitutional law and legislative or
                statutory law, including the customary one. The Constitutional law is accepted as a fundamental and
                supreme law. The statutory law is regarded as an ordinary law and is to be

                150 Rawls, op. cit., at 69. Jha, op. cit. at 135


                <a id="pageno">[pg:94]</a>

                enacted and enforced subject to the ambit of Constitutional law that means it must be framed in
                conformity with the Constitution. The law which is not confirmed with the Constitution cannot have any
                standing.<br><br>

                This distinction between the fundamental law and the ordinary law is based on the concept of sovereignty
                of a country. Where popular sovereignty prevails the Constitutional law is the supreme law. Thus, there
                are two kinds of laws, one which governs the state and the other by means of which the state governs,
                152 And the power of judicial review is exercised to that of statutory laws not that of Constitutional
                law.<br><br>

                In this way, the practical legal effect of such classification is that if the legislature frames laws in
                contrary of the Constitutional limitations, directions and restrictions such laws are unconstitutional
                and legally void. Generally, there is a Constitutional limitation to the parliament that it cannot enact
                the laws that are contrary to any of the Constitutional provisions, either of fundamental rights or any
                else. So, the courts could refuse to enforce the laws which are repugnant to the Constitution and such
                unconstitutional laws do not create any rights and liabilities, nor bind the citizens. According to the
                realistic approach of law the statutory law before its application is a lifeless organ. After it is
                judicially tested, it is brought into practical operation. It may, therefore, be said that the judge
                made law is the real law, which infuses life and energy into the statutory law when it is put into
                practical operation. 153<br><br>

                3.4.10 Models of the System of Judicial Review<br><br>

                According to the nature of Constitution and judicial system adopted in the

                modern state, the model of judicial review can be classified into four types: B. MACIVER, THE MODERN
                STATE 248, Oxford University Press, London (1960). To this theory, the law is what the judges say it is.
                Justice Holmes says law never is.

                but is only about to be, it is not only what the judges have said, but what they will do. So,

                all laws are Judge made. (See R.W.M. DIAS, DIAS JURISPRUDENCE 447-449, Aditya

                The English, American and Continental models are the subjects of discussion. Most of the jurists do go
                with this classification of models. Of the aforesaid models, the Nepalese model is something unique and
                hybrid model, which might be a reference for other countries in this regard.<br><br>

                3.4.10.1 The English Model of Constitutional Review<br><br>

                The English Model of Constitutional review (the British) is based on the court practices irrespective of
                the presence of a written Constitution and consequently there is no express provision for judicial
                review in this system. Since the parliamentary supremacy prevails, which is antagonistic to the doctrine
                of Constitutional supremacy, it is always considered that no court in England is competent to question
                the legal validity of any Act of parliament, and courts only do restart to indirect judicial review at
                times against administrative actions. Nevertheless, today, the role of the courts in reviewing
                administrative actions and legislative Acts and decisions has become far more active and creative.
                154<br><br>

                3.4.10.2 The American Model of Constitutional Review<br><br>

                In American Model there is written Constitution, but there is a marked absence of any specific
                provisions for judicial review. The court adopted the power of judicial review with an ascertain that
                the Constitution impliedly contain such power. In America, the system of judicial review, in fact,
                evolved through the exercise of court practice. Dr. Jha writes The

                Limited, London (1980).

                <a id="pageno">[pg:96]</a>

                American judiciary helped in tending the extraordinary growth of the system of judicial review through
                the processes of Constitutional Interpretations, 185<br><br>

                In American model, especially in the U.S.A. the courts have not power to refuse to enforce a statute on
                account of its supposed unconstitutionality. Nor can a court declare a statute unconstitutional and void
                when the objection to it is merely that it is unjust and oppressive, and violates nights and privileges
                of the citizen, unless it can be shown that such injustice is prohibited, or such rights and privilege
                are guaranteed by the Constitution, 156<br><br>

                Though judicial review is not explicitly mentioned in the U.S. Constitution, the system has been most
                effective one to that of other countries. The Supreme Court argued in Marbury v. Madison (1803) that
                because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land (it says as much in Article VI) and because it
                is the province of the judiciary to uphold the law, it follows that, when state laws and even acts of
                Congress are inconsistent with a provision of the Constitution, the former must yield to the latter and
                must be declared void by the courts. The same principle holds, of course, with regard to executive
                action contrary to the Constitution. Supreme Court pronouncements on questions of Constitutionality are
                final and binding for all other courts and governmental authorities, state and federal.<br><br>

                In the U.S. system of judicial review, Constitutional questions can be Fised only in connection with
                actual "cases and controversies." The courts do not render advisory opinions to the government. Although
                the requirements to litigate cases have been relaxed by the Supreme Court, the rule still is that courts
                will not decide a Constitutional question unless it is rooted in a controversy in which the parties have
                a direct, personal

                interest; this can sometimes frustrate efforts to obtain pronouncements on disputed issues. In the
                American system courts, moreover, are the guardians of the Constitution, but they are not bound to
                consider all the provisions of the Constitution justifiable. Under the doctrine of "political questions"
                the Supreme Court has refused at times to apply standards prescribed by or deducible from the
                Constitution to issues that it believed could be better decided by the political branches of government.
                For instance, Article IV, 4, provides that the states must have a republican form of government. Since
                Luther v. Borden (1849) it is settled that the court will not use the provision to invalidate state
                laws; it is for Congress and the president to decide whether a particular state government is republican
                in form. Many military and foreign policy questions, such as the question of the Constitutionality of a
                particular war, have been likewise considered political and therefore nonjusticiable.<br><br>

                In the first half of the 19th century the Supreme Court succeeded in reinforcing the newly born
                structures of the federal system by interpreting generously those provisions of the Constitution that
                concern federal judicial power and those that set limitations on the states powers to regulate
                interstate commerce. Later, when Congress began to enact laws intended to regulate some aspects of the
                nation's economic processes, the court was very cautious in granting the necessary powers. Up to the New
                Deal years (1932-37), the court, while admitting several federal regulatory interventions, also ruled
                that some economic relations, such as labour relations, lay almost entirely outside the scope of the
                commerce clause (the clause that gives Congress the power to regulate "commerce among the states") and
                were therefore matters exclusively for state legislation. After 1937 the court lifted the obstacles it
                had previously erected to federal interventions in the economic and social transactions of the nation.
                Today, under the new interpretation of the commerce clause laid down in such decisions as Wickard v.
                Filburn(1942) and under the doctrine of the federal spending power first enunciated in U.S. v. Butler
                (1936), Congress


                <a id="pageno">[pg:98]</a>

                can make laws with respect to practically all subjects it deems of national relevance and in need of
                regulation from the centre.

                In the area of separation of federal powers the court has countenanced in the course of time a transfer
                of powers to the executive and to administrative agencies that probably was not envisaged by the
                Founding Fathers. Because all legislative powers are conferred by Article 1, 1, of the Constitution upon
                Congress, the court at first ruled that such powers couldn't be delegated by Congress to the executive.
                This doctrine was much diluted in the 20th century when it became clear that delegated legislation was
                necessary to govern a system of mixed economy. The court's attitude favourable to a reinforcement of the
                executive within the Constitutional system has manifested itself also in other respects, notably in the
                field of foreign affairs. But the court has been able also to draw boundaries to an excessive expansion
                of the presidency. It has ruled that the president cannot, under the pretext of an emergency, disregard
                rules of conduct prescribed by Congress precisely for the circumstances of the case (Youngstown Sheet
                and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 1952). It has established that the prerogative of the president to keep
                confidential statements secret must yield to the need of the judiciary to enforce criminal justice if
                the secret does not relate strictly to military or diplomatic matters (Nixon v.

                U.S., 1973).<br><br>

                Until the New Deal the court used the provisions of the Constitution concerning individual rights
                primarily to protect property and economic liberties. That use helped to preserve a system of
                laissez-faire economy against state and federal efforts to interfere with the market. In particular, the
                "due process" clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments (no person shall be deprived of "life,
                liberty, or property, without due process (Lochner v. New York, 1905; Adair v. U.S., 1908). In the
                second half of the of law") were often employed by the court to invalidate social legislation 20th
                century the posture of the court has changed entirely. The court today seldom concerns itself with
                economic liberties. It is engaged rather


                <a id="pageno">[pg:99]</a>
                in protecting citizens' non-economic freedoms as well as their equality before the law, focusing on
                issues such as civil and political rights, procedural rights in the criminal and administrative
                processes, or the right to privacy. In the course of developing this new jurisprudence the court has
                declared unconstitutional segregation in the schools (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954) and
                malapportionment in electoral districts (Baker v. Carr, 1962; Wesberry v. Sanders, 1964); it has
                defended the nights of the suspect and of the accused (Mapp v. Ohio, 1961; Miranda v. Arizona, 1966); it
                has liberalized voluntary abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973).<br><br>

                Viewed in the light of its two-century performance, U.S. judicial review can be assessed as an
                institution that defends the values of the political ideology prevailing in a given historical period
                against by and large occasional deviations from them on the part of the political branches of
                government. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, for example, the ideal of the minimal state and of
                a self-governing market was dominant with the elites of the Western world, and the Supreme Court did its
                best to enforce it in the peculiar context of the U.S. political system. At present the court is
                dedicated to furthering the values of the currently dominant ideal of a democracy: a system in which the
                equality and the non economic freedoms of persons are recognized and the state possesses all the
                necessary means to regulate the economy. Conflicts between the court and the political powers, state and
                federal, have occurred, but they have never been sharp except occasionally under particular
                circumstances: in the difficult years following the establishment of the new federal government and in
                the years of the Civil War; in the phase of transition from one to the other dominant political ideal
                (the New Deal years) and in the 1950s and 1960s, when the federal and state governments were seriously
                lagging behind in reshaping the legal system in accordance with fundamental requirements of the new
                democratic model.<br><br>

                3.4.10.3 The Continental Model of Constitutional Review

                The concept of judicial control appeared in Europe after the First World War in the Austrian
                Constitution of 1920 and, to a more limited extent elsewhere. Its first great expansion came, however,
                after the Second World War, most notably in Austria, in the federal Republic of Germany and in

                Italy, 157

                The federal Republic of Germany, which has had the Institution since shortly after the Second World War,
                gave it additional scope by a Constitutional amendment in 1969. In France, by contrast, It was almost
                certainly not the intention of the Constitution of 1958 to introduce judicial review. 158 And its
                existence in France to day is largely due to the land mark decision of Conseil Constitutional of 16 July
                1971; what may be seen as its confirmation in the constitutional amendment of 1974 is implicit

                rather than explicit.<br><br>

                In Europe, nevertheless, Justifications for Judicial review of legislation other than that of logical
                necessity were put forward in particular by way of response to the familiar argument that judicial
                review of legislation is "anty-majoritarian" or "anti-democratic" process, 159<br><br>

                The essential difference between the United States and the European model is in the way Constitutional
                review is organized. In the U.S.A., Constitutional review is exercised by the entire court system. In
                American Model (the judicial control over the Constitutionality of legislation) the "decentralized" type
                gives the power of control to all the judicial organ of a

                139 Glendon et al., op. cit.

                <a id="pageno">[pg:101]</a>

                given legal system. In Europe it is exercised by a unique specialized court. in European model, the
                centralized type of control confines the power of review to one signal judicial organ. 160 The typical
                civil law system contains at least two (and sometimes more) separate sets of courts for administrative
                and private law matters, each with its own supreme court, its own procedural and substantive rules and
                its own jurisdiction.<br><br>

                In the European system, constitutional review is organized differently. It is common in Europe to
                differentiate among categories of litigation (administrative, civil, criminal, commercial etc.) and to
                have them decided by different courts. Constitutional litigation too, is distinguished from other
                litigation and is dealt with separately. Mary Ann writes they are generally raised by a "Public
                Authority" i.e. government, Member of Parliament, court etc. and not by individual. 161 In the American
                system Constitutional review is lodged in the judicial system as a whole, and is not distinct from the
                administration of justice generally. All disputes, whatever their nature, are decided by the same court,
                by the same procedures, in essentially similar circumstances or controversies raised

                before the same court.<br><br>

                In European Model Unlike in America, the enforced legislation cannot be declared ultra-vires through
                judicial review. The Constitutionality of the legislation is generally scrutinized before the
                enforcement of the Act. In general the Constitutionality of a law is examined in the abstract not as in
                the U.S.A. in the context of a specific case; therefore the lawfulness of legislation is considered in
                general without taking into account the precise circumstances of any particular case, 162<br><br>

                Despite the difficulties that are perceived in the civil law countries as standing in the way of a
                system of judicial review of the Constitutionality of legislation, there has been considerable movement
                in the years since World War II toward the establishment of some form of review of legislative action,
                163 This especially so in those countries that have adopted Constitutions containing guarantees of
                enumerated fundamental rights, and where the Constitution can be amended only by a special procedure
                rather than simply by the ordinary legislative process. For example, in Italy and Germany the judicial
                power to review legislation not only exists but is actively exercised by the courts. In this context, so
                far as judicial review is concerned, France and England would appear to fall within one group of
                countries where its existence in a technical sense is denied, while Italy, Germany and the USA come
                within another group where judicial power to review legislation is actively exercised by the
                courts.<br><br>

                Conversely, judicial control of the constitutionality of legislation does not mean only judicial control
                of the constitutionality of parliamentary legislation; it may extend to or be restricted to subordinate
                legislation. Nevertheless, practices of the most countries are limited within the judicial control of
                the acts of the legislature. in Europe, judicial control of legislative act appeared after the First
                World War in the Austrian Constitution of 1920 and, to a more limited extent, elsewhere. Its first great
                expansion came, however, after the Second World War, most notably in Austria, in Germany and Italy 16 In
                France, by contrast, it was almost certainly not the intention of the Constitution of 1958 to introduce
                judicial review.<br><br>

                In the contemporary world, judicial review of legislation exists in many countries including even some,
                such as Yugoslavia, which adhere to the theory of unity of power rather than to that of the separation
                of powers. 165<br><br>

                <a id="pageno">[pg:103]</a>

                After all, in Europe the views are held that the period of history in which the institution of judicial
                review itself requires justification is over and that elfort should now be devoted rather to its
                preservation against hostile governments and to improvements in its practical operation, 166<br><br>

                The peculiar history of the judiciary in France-its identification with feudal oppression, its role in
                retarding even moderate reforms in pre revolutionary France, the post-revolutionary reaction against and
                the vestigial distrust of judges, plus the comparatively non-prestigious role of the modern
                civil-servant judge,-has militated against placing the power to review the Constitutionality of
                legislation in the judiciary 167 The ordinary civil courts are not even permitted to review the legality
                of administrative action, this task being reserved to the administrative tribunals within the executive
                branch. So, when France in 1985 instituted a system of Constitutional review of laws passed by
                parliament, it created a new government organ, the Constitutional Council. This body is authorized to
                review laws, but only at the request of the executive or the legislature, only before promulgation and
                only for the limited purpose of ascertaining whether the laws are in conformity with the Constitutional
                division of powers between the executive and the legislature. 168<br><br>

                Though Nepalese Model of Constitutional Review is close to that of American Model, there are some new
                and specific provisions for judicial review in Nepalese Constitution that has made Nepal different from

                relating to the Constitutional validity of laws in force in the territory of Nepal, and to issue order
                for the settlement of any Constitutional or legal question involved in any dispute of Public interest or
                concern. Thus, this Constitution has explicitly mentioned the provision of public interest litigation
                which is very much latest to that of Indian and American Models. In India and America there is a
                practice of PIL, but they have not explicitly mentioned the same in the Constitution. Similarly, the
                fundamental rights also have been specifically guaranteed in the Constitution. The Constitution has left
                the unlimited ground of locus standi. Any Nepalese citizen can file a writ petition asking the court to
                declare the legislative act void to the extent of inconsistency with the

                Constitution<br><br>

                Article 107 is the sole tool and the soul of judicial review of both legislation and of administrative
                action. It invests the supreme court of Nepal with the power of superintendence over legislature,
                administrative agencies bodies authorities\tribunals quasi-judicial bodies exercising ad judicatory
                powers. The nature and ambit of this power is both administrative (i.e. Superintendence jurisdiction)
                and judicial (i.e. judicial review). The court shall exercise this power in a very wide way, for
                example;<br><br>

                To prevent grave miscarriage of justice; • To prevent flagrant violation of law;

                on.

                Right to Approach the Court: Article 107 of the Constitution, in fact, has guaranteed the right to
                approach to the court in case any right of a

                ,including the rights other than the basic rights, is violated by any

                3.4.11 Grounds and limits of Judicial Review

                is normally a pattern of the written Constitution that under which the courts have generally the grounds
                for judicial review in the three conditions:

                If a statute or executive action is repugnant to the

                Constitution

                If a statute or executive action violates the fundamental rights that are guaranteed in the
                Constitution. If there is a legal question involved in any dispute of public

                interest.

                3.4.11.1 Limitations

                The power of judicial review whether it is expressly ensured by the Constitution like in Nepal or is
                assumed by the judiciary in the absence of such specific conferment of the power like in the USA is
                subject to certain limitations. The courts cannot act suo moto and proceed to strike down a law as
                illegal or unconstitutional without the matter being brought by an aggrieved party before it.<br><br>

                In United States v. Butler169 Justice Stone observed:

                The power of courts to declare a statute unconstitutional is subject to two guiding principles of
                decision which ought never to be absent from judicial consciousness. One is that courts are concerned
                only with the power to scrutinize enact statutes not with their wisdom. The other is that while
                unconstitutional exercise of power by the executive and legislature branches of the government is
                subject to judicial restraint the only check upon our

                297 US 1, 78-80 L. Ed. 477 (1936) quoted in Chatterjee, op. cit., at 43-44

                <a id="pageno">[pg:106]</a>

                own exercise of power is our own sense of self restraint. For the removal of se laws from the statute
                books appeal lies not to the courts but to the allet and to the processes of democratic government

                oficial legislation: The courts are empowered to interpret the laws, but Jual departments can neither
                make nor executive them. Neither can it fere with the other departments.<br><br>

                The judicial department may not encroach upon the legislative department. to the province of the
                legislature to enact, amend or repeal a statute, and the courts will not, theoretically, by judicial
                interpretation enlarge, alter or and an enactment. The judicial function to be exercised in construing a
                statue is limited to ascertaining the intention of the legislature therein pressed... the means or
                methods adopted by the legislature for promoting a public purpose is for legislative determination and
                the courts will not fere with the large discretion of the legislature in promoting the general welfare
                or in performing the duties entrusted to it by the Constitution. It is well settled that the courts
                cannot convene or adjourn the legislature and that they cannot interfere in any way with the legislative
                process in eacting laws, or with other legislative functions."170<br><br>

                The leading feature of the Constitution is the separation and distribution of the powers of the
                government. It takes care to separate the executive. egislative and judicial powers, and to define their
                limits. The executive do neither legislative act, nor the legislature any executive act, and either can
                exercise any judicial authority and likewise the judiciary can In this way being the court's authority
                co-ordinate with that of the legislature and the executive, and neither superior nor inferior, but each

                with equal dignity, the courts have certain limitations while using the power of judicial review in
                their appointed sphere.

                For the purpose of judicial review, the courts, in particular, may have two

                types of limitations;

                Constitutional limitations, and

                Judicial self restraint

                Constitutional limitations of the judiciary are expressly embodied in the Constitution. However, the
                limitations of judicial self- restraint are the inexplicit principles that are to be followed by the
                judiciary itself. Some of the self imposed limitations traditionally applied by the judiciary
                include:<br><br>

                There is no scope for a judicial review of non-statutory administrative actions, since it creates no
                legal rights. For the purpose of justifiable right, the right must be of a legal rather than of a
                factual character. Existence of a right means a right which has been obviously in picture and which does
                not depend for its assumed character upon a declaration by a court after trying complicated issues and
                marshalling evidence. In this regard, according to the well-established principles of the English law a
                relief under the prerogative writs cannot be granted to purely private persons who have not legal or
                statutory existence. The English writs are directed against persons or authorities who hold office of a
                public nature and as such are public authorities. One of the coordinal limitations on the court's power
                of

                judicial review of legislation on Constitutional grounds is that it will decide only a ripened
                controversy in which the results are of immediate consequence to the parties. 172<br><br>

                The validity of the Act has to be tested objectively.

                The court derives the power of judicial review from not any other source but the Constitution. So, the power of judicial review can be applied only outside the Constitution. The court cannot Judge the Constitutionality of the Constitution itself.<br><br>

The provisions of the Constitution generally fall into two types; namely, those which are not enforceable and those which are enforceable. The provisions which are enforceable are only the subject of judicial review. Judicial review, thus should relate to a justiciable right of the petitioner, as distinguished from a political or non-justiciable question. The matters relating to foreign affairs, policies of the government, merits of emergency, dissolution of Parliament, the question of declaring war, directive principles and state policies, non-statutory discretionary matter, are generally considered as justiciable by the court of law, 173 <br><br>

It is the duty of the court to recognize and give effect to the Constitution as the paramount law, and by refusing to enforce the legislative enactment, practically nullify it when the will of the legislature, as expressed in statute form, and the will of the people, as expressed in the Constitution, are in conflict and the two cannot stand together in such a case as the legislature power is conferred by the Constitution. 174<br><br>

The court will not listen, to an objection made to the Constitutionality of an act by one, whose rights are not affected by it, and who consequently can have no interest in

defeating it.175<br><br>




173. Despite the classical rules of limitation of the power of judicial review, the Nepalese court has exercised its judicial power on issues relating to dissolution of Parliament, directive principles and policy matters that involve with the fundamental rights of the people.

The court cannot run a race of opinions upon points of right, reason, and expediency with the law making power, can only arrest the execution of a statute when it conflicts with the

Constitution, 176<br><br>

Nor can a statute be declared unconstitutional merely because in the opinion of the court it violates one or more of the fundamental principles of public liberty, unless it shall be found that those principles are placed beyond legislative encroachment by the previsions of the Constitution itself, 177<br><br>

. It is necessary for the judiciary to point out some particular in which either in form or substance, it is inconsistent with the Constitution while showing its invalidity.<br><br>

. The court should declare the provision of the statue ultra-vires to the extent of inconsistency and leave valid to the extent or consistency in a situation when a statute may sometimes be valid in part and invalid in other particulars. 178 The court should test the bona-fide intention of the

petitioner. 179<br><br>

• The court does not anticipate a question of Constitutionality in

advance.<br><br>

• The court does not decide the question of Constitutionality unless absolute necessary is required to do so. The court does not declare a statute void in a doubtful case. • The court does not express Constitutional opinion suomoto. • The court does not entertain Constitutional question at the

instance of a volunteer.<br><br>

The court doesn't entertain Constitutional question at the instance of a person who has derived some benefit from the

statute impugned.<br><br>

. The court does not formulate a rule of Constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to

be applied.<br><br>

The court does not determine itself as a maker of the law etc. The right of seeking judicial review depends on the facts and merit of each individual case; there cannot be a review of an

abstract proposition of law, 180<br><br>

3.4.11.1.1 Judicial policy-restraint v. Activism<br><br>

In terms of mind set and behaviour, the judges can roughly be divided into two categories, namely, the strict constructionists and the liberalists.<br><br>

If Courts try to be faithful to the text of Constitution, they will for that very reason be forced to decide between competing conceptions of political morality. It is less misleading to say that the broad clauses of the Constitution delegate power to the Court to enforce its own conceptions of

political morality, 181<br><br>

There are two contrast and very general philosophies of how the Courts should decide difficult or controversial constitutional issues. They are called - the programs of judicial activism and judicial restraint, 182<br><br>

The program of judicial activism holds that Courts should accept the directions of the so-called vague Constitutional provisions in the spirit. They should work out principles of legality, equality, and the rest, revise<br><br>

                                     these principles from time to time in the light of what seems to the Court fresh moral insight, and judge the acts of parliament, the state and so forth. The program of judicial constraint, on the contrary, argues that Courts should allow the decisions of other branches of government to stand, even when they offend the judges' own sense of the principles required by the broad Constitutional doctrines, except when these decisions are so offensive to political morality that they would violate the provisions on any plausible interpretation or, perhaps, when a contrary decisions is required by clear precedent. 183<br><br>

We must, however, notice a distinction between two forms of judicial restraint, for there are two different, and indeed incompatible, grounds on which that policy might be based. The first is a theory of political skepticism that might be described in this way. The policy of judicial activism presupposes a certain objectivity of moral principle; in particular it presupposes that citizens do have certain moral rights against the state, like a moral right to equality of public education or to fair treatment by the police. Only if such moral rights exist in some sense can activism be justified as a program based on something beyond the judge's personal preferences. The skeptical theory, on the other hand, attacks activism at its roots; it argues that in fact individuals have no such moral rights against the state. They have only such legal rights as the Constitution or law expressly grants them, and these are limited to the plain and uncontroversial violations of public morality that the framers must have land actually in mind, or that have since been established in a line of

precedent. 184<br><br>

The second is a theory of judicial difference. Contrary to the skeptical theory, this assumes that citizens do have moral rights against the state beyond what the law expressly grant them, but it points out that the character and strength of these rights are debatable and argues that

political institutions other than Courts are responsible for deciding which

3.4.12.1 Doctrine of Common Right and Reason: This doctrine was evolved by chief justice Coke in England. It had its foundation in Magna Charta of 1215 A.D., which was a document imposing limitations on the monarchical powers. The whole substance of the doctrine is that a law or custom which is arbitrary and against reason is void. Coke enunciated this doctrine in Bonham's case in 1910.185 <br><br>

3.4.12.2 Doctrine of Pith and Substance: The phrase "pith and substance" means true nature and character. This doctrine relates to the violation of Constitutional delimitation of legislative powers in a federal state. Under it the court ascertains whether the alleged encroachment is merely incidental or substantial. The doctrine postulates, for its application, that the impugned law is substantially with the legislative competence of the legislature that made it but only incidentally encroached upon the legislative field of another legislature. The doctrine saves this incidental encroachment if in reality the law is in within the legislative field of the particular legislature which enacted it. This doctrine was evolved by the Privy Council to ascertain the Constitutionality of Canadian and Australian statutes regarding the violation of the rules of the distribution of powers, 186 <br><br>

3.4.12.3 Doctrine of Implied Powers: This doctrine was evolved in America by Chief Justice Marshall by the exercise of power of judicial it This was necessary in view of the residual powers resting in the review amplified the owners of the federal government and strengthened

states, Implied powers are those powers which are not expressly laid down in the fundamental law, but are necessary and proper to carry out into effect and execution any of the express powers. The doctrine of implied power can be invoked where without the said power the material provision of an Act would become impossible & enforcement. <br><br>

3.4.12.4 Doctrine of Implied Prohibition: This doctrine is ante-thesis of

the doctrine of implied powers. The prohibition is impliedly applied against the exercise of power by the federal or state legislative which has not been expressly conferred to it. This doctrine is basically applied in the United States of America and in Australia where the express powers are given to the federal legislature and the residuary powers are vested in the union legislature. Thus, in America, the doctrine has been founded on the principle that express grant of powers to the federal legislature impliedly prohibits the federal legislature to interfere with the reserved powers. <br><br>

3.4.12.5 Doctrine of Incidental Powers and Incidental Encroachment:

The doctrine of incidental powers means that in a case where on the face of the statute it appears that a legislative subject of the statute falls both in the union as well as the state list, but a close scrutiny it becomes clear that it falls merely incidentally in one list but belongs substantially to the other list, such case of incidental power cannot be regarded as the case of substantial encroachment.<br><br>

The doctrine of incidental encroachment means that in enacting a legislation the legislature has not traveled beyond the legislative field allotted to it by the arrangement of distribution of powers in the Constitution and there has been merely incidental encroachment of powers which does not affect the main scheme of the distribution of powers.  <br><br>

3.4.12.6 Doctrine of Colorable legislation: If a legislature has no power to legislate on an item either because it is not included in the list assigned

 <a id="pageno">[pg no: 114] </a>


to it as per the Constitutional provisions or on account of limitations imposed in the Constitution, but the legislature enacts a statute in assumption of such power it is a colorable legislation. It has reference only to the legislative incompetence. If the legislature enacts law in pretence of the exercise of its legislative power though actually it does not possess such power, the legislation is void, as the legislature makes legislative enactment only in colorable exercise of its power. <br><br>

3.4.12.7 Doctrine of Fraud on Power: According to this doctrine the

legislature has really power but does not exercise that power and merely pretends to have exercised the power. For instance, if the legislature makes the law for acquiring property providing merely an illusory compensation or if the provisions of acquisition are so designed as not to have provided for compensation, or if the provisions are arbitrary, such legislation is fraud on power, in the eye of law it is not a law at all, but is a mere pretence of law and the court will not take notice of such law. <br><br>

3.4.12.8 Doctrine of Fraud on the Constitution: This doctrine means

that when there is a Constitutional restriction or prohibitions to make a legislative enactment but the legislature in spite of the prohibitions and restrictions makes enactment it is a fraud on the Constitution. The distinction between the fraud on power and the fraud on Constitution is basic. The former is applicable when the legislature has power to enact but does not exercise that power. The latter is applicable when the legislature has no power, but in spite of it makes enactment in pretence of its power. Nevertheless, the result in both cases is the same and the legislative enactment is void.188 <br><br>

3.4.12.9 Doctrine of Repugnance: Repugnancy arises regarding the

cannot enact the law which is inconsistent to the Constitutional violation of the Constitutional provisions and limitations. The legislature provisions including the fundamental rights. To this doctrine, the law

188. See D. C. Wadha v. State of Bihar, AIR 1987 SC 579.



<a id="pageno">[pg no. 115]  </a>


enacted without legislative competence is still born and of no legal force. It has no life at all. But the inconsistent law may have life in its inception but it becomes eclipsed by another law and hence becomes unenforceable.

3.4.12.10 Doctrine of Delegated legislation: In generally, the law making function solely belongs to the legislature. The executive or administrative body has no legislative power. Therefore, the legislature cannot delegate its essential legislative function to the executive and if any such delegation is made such delegation is ultra-virus. But the legislature due to pressure of work can, however, delegate non-essential legislative function to the executive or to any other body by giving adequate guidance and directions. The legislation made under this process is delegated legislation which is also scrutinized by the court of law for its validity if the question is arisen.<br><br>

3.4.12.11 Doctrine of Eclipse and Revitalization: This doctrine applies

to the case of a pre-Constitution statute. If the Constitutional ban is removed the statute becomes free from eclipse, is revitalized and becomes enforceable again. But the post Constitution statute enacted in contravention of the Constitutional prohibitions stand quite on a different footing, such statutes are still born and have no life since its beginning as law enacted in violation of Constitutional restrictions are no law at all; they cannot be revitalized.<br><br>

In Bhikaji v. State of Madhya Pradesh 89 the question arose whether a law which was void before the amendment in respect of citizens was automatically revived by the amendment of the relevant provisions of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the true position is that the impugned law became as it were eclipsed for the time being by the fundamental right. The effect of the Constitution (first amendment) Act, 1951 was to remove the shadow and to make the impugned Act free from all blemish or infirmity.<br><br>

189. AIR 1955 SC 781

   <a id="pageno">[pg no: 116]</a>



The American doctrine that a statue void for unconstitutionality is dead and cannot be vitalized by a subsequent amendment of the Constitution does not apply to laws which become void under article 13 (India). Under that article the offending statute is not wiped out altogether, but becomes word only for the purpose of the exercise of the fundamental rights to persons entitled to exercise such rights. As soon as the fundamental right is taken away by a subsequent amendment, the offending statute becomes enforceable with effect from the date when the Constitutional amendment comes into force, 190 <br><br>

The question of applicability of the doctrine of eclipse to post Constitution laws was discussed in Deep Chand v. State of U. P19. Mr. Justice Subba Rao delivering the judgment on behalf of the majority pointed out the difference between clauses (1) and (2) of article 13. He said: there is a clear distinction between the two clauses. Under clause (1) a pre Constitution law subsists except to the extent of its inconsistency with the provisions of part 111; whereas no post Constitution law can be made contravening the provisions of part 111 and, therefore, the law to that extent though made is a nullity from its inception.' He further observed that the Constitution in express terms makes the power of a legislature to make laws in regard to the entries in the lists of the seventh schedule subject to the other provisions of the Constitution and thereby circumscribes or reduces the said power by limits laid down in part 111 of the Constitution; it follows from the premises that a law made derogation or in excess of that power would be ab-initio void wholly to the extent of the contravention as the case may be and the doctrine of eclipse can be invoked only in the case of a law valid when made but the shadow is cast on it by supervening Constitutional inconsistency. When the shadow is removed the impugned Act is free from all blemish or infirmity.<br><br>

34.12.12 Doctrine of Prospective Overruling: According to this doctrine if any enactment or Constitutional amendment was void but was acquiesced in for a pretty long time then it should not be declared void with retrospective effect but should be so declared only with prospective affect. The nature of its application depends on the discretion of the Supreme Court.<br><br>

3.4.12.13 Doctrine of Constitutional Silences or Implied Restriction: The Constitution makers have embodied many Constitutional restrictions and limitations. The court of law can interpret and bring out such restrictions and they may be called Constitutional silences or implied restrictions. The court in Nepal has explained the doctrine of implied restriction in the parliament dissolution II it case, and others where the court held that there was implied condition for Prime Minister to exercise the power of Art 53(4), 192<br><br>

3.4.12.14 Doctrine of Ripeness for Review: According to this doctrine the judicial review of legislative Acts can be invoked in the court of law only when a person is actually aggrieved by the legislative Act and not on any threatened injury. No relief can be given to a person who has no injury of any kind of the impugned Act. This doctrine also implies that the court has jurisdiction of review of the legislation only when it is already enacted and not at the Bill Stage.<br><br>

3.4.12.15 Doctrine of Implied Repeal: The doctrine of implied repeal is

founded on the principle that the last intention of the legislation should prevail. If an Act is passed intending to repeal the existing statute in full or in part, but no express mention is made of this intention, then by implication, the last intention of the legislature should prevail and the previous statute or part thereof, as the case may be, would be deemed to have been repealed. It may be taken as an indirect act on the part of the

  <a id="pageno">pgno.118 </a>


legislature to remove the previous statute from the statute book. This is so when the legislature does not record its intentions in open and express words, but makes such enactment which in affect destroys the previous statutes.<br><br>

3.4.12.16 Doctrine of Severability: This doctrine says that it is to be

saved if a portion of a particular provision which is not in infringement of a Constitutional provision and is separable. This doctrine has been founded on considerations of equity and prudence. If the valid and invalid parts are so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated the entire provision is to be declared void. In determining the legislative intent the court may take into account the history, object, title and also preamble of the Constitution. The court in Nepal has applied this doctrine in Bal Krishna case and others, 193<br><br>

Doctrine of severability appears prima-facie that if any provision of a statute is found to be inconsistent with any of the fundamental rights, only that provision would be declared void but not the rest of the statute. But this is not always so. This is possible only when the inconsistent provision of the impugned statute is clearly severable from the provisions which are not inconsistent. But when it is inextricably wound up with the other provisions of the Act, then the whole statute demands nullification. The statute in such case deserves to be struck down as unconstitutional and void. The supreme court of India discussed the doctrine of severability in greater detail in R. M. D. C. v. Union of India194 and laid down the following rules:<br><br>

⚫ in determining whether the valid parts of a statute are separable from the invalid parts thereof, it is the intention of the legislature that is the determining factor. The test to be applied is whether the

194. AIR 1957 SC 628 quoted in Chatterjee op. cit., at 53.

   <a id="pageno">[pg no: 119] </a>



legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute was invalid.<br><br>

If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated from one another, then the invalidity of a portion must result in the invalidity of the Act in it's entirely. On the other hand, if they are so distinct and separate that after striking out what is invalid, what remains is in itself a complete code independent of the rest, then it will be upheld notwithstanding that the rest has become unenforceable.<br><br>

. Even when the provisions which are valid or distinct and separate from those which are invalid, if they all from part of a single scheme which is intended to be operative as a whole, then also the invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the whole. Likewise, when the valid and the invalid parts of a statute are independent and do not form part of a scheme but what is left after omitting the invalid portion is so thin and truncated as to be in substance different from what it was when it emerged out of the legislature then also it will be rejected in its entirely.<br><br>

. The separability of the valid and invalid provisions of a statute does not depend on whether the law is enacted in the same section or different section; it is not the form but the substance of the matter that is material and that has to be ascertained on an examination of the Act as a whole and of the setting of the relevant provisions therein.<br><br>

• If after the invalid portion is expunged from the statute what remains cannot be enforced without making alterations and modifications therein, then the whole of it must be struck down as void as otherwise it will amount to judicial legislation.<br><br>

In determining the legislative intention on the question of separability it will be legitimate to take into account the history of the legislation, its object, title and the preamble to it.<br><br>

3.4.12.17 Doctrine of Political Question: Political question is

distinguished from a political justice. In fact, the political question is a problem of the state. The court by its sense or judicial self-restraint refrains from entering into a political question. It is within the province of the executive and legislative branch. The recognition of a foreign state, the matters relating wars and treaties etc. are instances of political questions in respect of which the court generally avoids deliberation. But the line of demarcation between political justice and political question is very thin.<br><br>

In a technical sense, the court does not decide political question but in a broader and realistic view, the court decides many political matters. For example in Nepal, the court has reviewed the litigation regarding political matters. <br><br>

The Tanakpur Barrage195, parliament dissolution, and Radheshyam, cases are its unique example, where the court has also held the justification of political matters.<br><br>

In America many of the important Constitutional questions were avoided from the purview of judicial review in the name of political questions. But in 1962 the Supreme Court of the United States of America involved her activities even into the matter of politics. The case of Baker, Reynolds 199, 298 etc. are its examples.<br><br>

In India, the plea of non-justiciability of a political question was raised by the central government as early as 1971 in Madhav Rao Scindia v. India. The argument was that recognition of a ruler by the president

  <a id="pageno">[pgno:121]  </a>





political question and that the court ought not to take cognizance of the matter raised in that case. But the court rejected the argument saying was a that the power of the president to determine the status of the rulers by canceling or withdrawing recognition to abolish the concept of rule ship with a view to effectuate government policy was liable to be challenged. In this way, limitation of political question in the consideration of a Constitutional case is merely moral and not legal.<br><br>

The doctrine of political question in Judicial review is a self limiting doctrine evolved by the court itself and appears to be related to the doctrine of separation of powers. In this regard the court in India remarked that the doctrine of political question is invoked by the government when it seeks non-review ability of certain actions or decisions taken by it.<br><br>

While the doctrine may not be involved liberally so as to adversely affect judicial review, it need not be rejected completely also as there may be an occasion when a may arise to which no legally ascertainable standard may be applicable and may be regarded as non-justiciable on that account.201<br><br>

3.4.12.18 Doctrine of Harmonious Interpretation: To this doctrine the

Constitution should be so interpreted as to give affect to all its parts. The presumption is that no conflict or repugnancy was intended by the framers between the various provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, it has been laid down that if certain provisions in the Constitution appear to be in conflict with each other, these provisions should be interpreted so as to effect a reconciliation between then so that, if possible effect could be given to all. Our court has held this principle in parliament dissolution case.<br><br>

3.4.12.19 Doctrine of Natural Justice: The doctrine of natural justice is very old conception in the history of human civilization. In England this doctrine finds its place in Magna Charta in 1215 A.D. In the seventeenth century chief justice Coke interpreted on Magna Charta, where it was held that justice cannot be sold, justice or right cannot be denied and justice or right cannot be deferred. In America this doctrine became prominent due to the evolution of "due process in the judicial arena and it was specifically brought into operation by the 14th amendment of 1868. In Nepal also, the doctrine has been embodied in the Constitution.<br><br>

3.4.12.20 Doctrine of Inherent Power: The main point involved in this doctrine is whether the executive can ever assume Constitutional making or legislative function even in the case of any national urgency. In America the Supreme Court held that in no case the president can assume legislative function when it is not provided in the Constitution. The Supreme Court of India has also settled the point decisively that the president of India being the executive head has no power to exercise Constitution making or legislative function under inherent power unless there be specific provision for it in the Constitution.202 In Nepal, a long debate has been still in unsettle even the debate has taken place since the litigation relating to the appointment of the ambassador raised in the Supreme Court in 2048 B.S. as the first Constitutional litigation under the new Constitution. However, the court has tried to adopt the similar idea to that of India and America in this regard.203<br><br>

3.4.13 Judicial Review and Concept of Unconstitutionality<br><br>

The word unconstitutional has a different import and meaning in different countries. In India as in America, the word unconstitutional is used with reference to the invalidity of the legislative Acts and also with reference to the invalidity of the executive and administrative orders and actions.<br><br>

202. Madhav Rao Scindia v. India AIR 1971 SC 530. 2

203. Also see, Radheshyam case, NLR 2048, op. cit..

 <a id="pageno">pgno:123   </a>





Whereas, in England, it has reference merely to the actions and orders of the executive or administrative authorities.<br><br>

In Nepal, the term unconstitutional like in India and America refers to the invalidity of the legislative Acts and also to the invalidity of the executive action. Art 88 of the Constitution has vested the exclusive powers to the supreme judiciary of Nepal to determine all questions relating to Constitutional validity i.e. legislative Acts or administrative actions,204<br><br>

The statute may be unconstitutional if it is enacted in the absence of legislative competence, in violation of fundamental rights or in contravention of other Constitutional restrictions. So, a law to be valid must conform to the Constitutional norms. A statute which is not within the scope of legislative authority, or which offends some Constitutional restriction or prohibition is unconstitutional and hence invalid.<br><br>

3.4.13.1 Nature of Unconstitutionality<br><br>

Unconstitutional statutes may be of two kinds;<br><br>

1. Still-born statutes which are void from the very beginning of their

enactment, and <br><br>

2. The statutes which are initially valid but subsequently because of some Constitutional unenforceable.

provisions

become

invalid

and unenforceable. <br><br>

In the first case the law is enacted in the absence of legislative competence arising out of distribution of powers in violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution, and in violation of other Constitutional restrictions. In the second case the pre-Constitution law, though initially valid, becomes invalid due to subsequent events. <br><br>

204 See THE INTERIM CONSTITUTION OF NEPAL Art 107 (2007).

   <a id="pageno">pgno:124  </a>



For example, in Nepal many laws enacted before the promulgation of the new Constitution were initially valid and consistent to that of pre Constitution but many of them subsequently became invalid and unenforceable so as being contrary to this existing Constitutional provisions.<br><br>

3.4.14 Distinction between Ultra-vires and Repugnant Legislation<br><br>

The distinction between the two kinds of unconstitutional laws; namely the law which is Ultra -vires, and the law which is repugnant, is vital and it has great relevance to the method and approach regarding the determination of the question of unconstitutionality of a legislative Act. The fundamental concept of the doctrine of ultra-vires with reference to the legislative Act is that the Act is enacted in excess of the powers possessed by the particular legislature.205 This doctrine proceeds on the basis that the legislature has limited powers under the Constitution. If the legislature has defined limits its powers under the Constitution the doctrine of ultra-vires would confine the legislature to these limits and would no allow it to travel beyond its limits and competence. In the case of repugnancy the law is in respect to any matter assigned to the legislature, but its provisions disregard Constitutional prohibitions. Here, once the provisions are removed, the law will become effective without re enactment.206<br><br>

3.4.14.1 Grounds for Unconstitutionality<br><br>

Due to legislative incompetence arising out of the distribution of powers.<br><br>

Due to delegation of essential legislative function by the legislature to the executive.<br><br>

   <a id="pageno">pgno: 125   </a>




. Due to violation of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution.<br><br>

. Due to the violation of other Constitutional rustications and

limitations affecting legislative competence and jurisdiction. On account of infringement of the principle of natural justice.<br><br>

There are two kinds of legal effect of these grounds namely, the Ultra-vires and the repugnance;

The law enacted without legislative competence on account of the violation of the rules of distribution of powers, or on account of the infringement of fundamental rights or for the infringement of other Constitutional restrictions which prohibit the legislature from enacting laws framed in the absence of legislative competence and is still-born and void ab initio. It is the case of Ultra-vires.<br><br>

- When the legislature has competence to enact law, but the law is enacted in violation of some Constitutional restrictions, such law is not still-born, that is not void ab initio, but is only unenforceable and if the prohibitions are removed the law becomes enforceable. This is the case of repugnance..<br><br>

3.4.15 Duty and Obligation of the Court: When Unconstitutionality is Raised<br><br>

The court can determine the Constitutionality of a legislative Act to the extent it is essential to decide the case. 207 The court has first to determine whether the legislature in enacting the impugned statute had legislative competency according to the distribution of legislative powers. The Court has also to consider if the statute has infringed fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution. Further, if it be a statute having extra

            territorial operation, it has to be considered whether it possesses territorial nexus, 208<br><br>

            The Indian supreme court has laid down the following tests to determine the Constitutionality of a legislative Act; <br><br>Whether the legislative Act is within the legislative power

            assigned to the particular legislature.<br><br> ii. If the Act is passed by a state legislature and its operation extends beyond the boundaries of the state, in that case

            whether it has territorial nexus.<br><br>

            If there is any other Constitutional restrictions or limitations which put fetters on the legislative power of such legislature.

            If those tests are not fulfilled the law is invalid. In our context the court takes the reference of Constitutional grounds in scrutinizing the Constitutionality of the statute. But there is a lack of specific guidelines in this regard. The court has to expound the essential rules for test of the statute. The judicial function of assessing the Constitutional legitimacy of legislation is both delicate and responsible.210 To declare a statute unconstitutional places an onerous burden on the courts, for a statute is enacted by an elected legislature which is conversant with the needs and aspiration of the people. The courts, therefore, don't hold legislation unconstitutional in a light vein. They have to draw a balance between the felt necessities of the time" and Constitutional fundamentals. As has already been stated, the courts impose on themselves a good deal of self restraint in performing their task of judicial review of legislation. The do not cavil at legislation but go to great lengths to uphold legislation courts will hold a statute unconstitutional only as a last resort. The courts impugned before them.<br><br>

            3.4.16 Effect of Unconstitutionality<br><br>

If a law is enacted in violation of Constitutional provisions, it has no legal effect and is unenforceable. Regarding the effect of unconstitutionality, in an American case, the court held that "an unconstitutional Act is not a law, it confers no rights, it imposes no duties, it affords no protection, it creates no office; it is in legal contemplation, as inoperative as through it has never been passed."211 A similar theme is present in certain observations of Mahajan J. in Keshavan case212, where the court held that an unconstitutional statute is void since its inception and anything done under it is void and illegal; even convictions made under it are set aside; anything under it, whether closed, completed or inchoate is wholly illegal and the person affected is entitled to relief in one shape or another.<br><br>

Despite of this, the effects of unconstitutionality can be listed in a precise

form;<br><br>

The virtual effect there of is that the decision operates as a judgment inert against all persons who many seek relief subsequently and it is not necessary for them to establish the unconstitutionality of the statute again.<br><br>

The courts are bound to ignore an unconstitutional law <br><br>As the doctrine of severability applies, the invalid portion is to be ignored when the law is declared invalid partially.<br><br>

If the unconstitutional portion is severable from the Constitutional, then only the former is affected; the statute is not regarded unconstitutional portion stands.<br><br>

If a person is prosecuted for contravening a section, a part of which has been decaled unconstitutional onus is cast on the accused to prove that his case falls under the unconstitutional portion.<br><br>

What is the effect on an unconstitutional statute of a Constitutional amendment which removes the Constitutional objection due to which the statute was declared invalid? This question has not risen in our contest yet, so, what would be the answer is still uncertain. But in Indian context, the court has settled this problem. The court in Sundaramier applying the doctrine of eclipse held that the portions of a statute declared bad under Art 286 were revived when the Art was amended so as to remove the Constitutional quencher. But this principle is not applied to a statute which may be invalid because of excessive delegation. A law was challenged before court on this ground. Pending the court's decision, an amending Act was enacted to remove the defect. The Supreme Court ruled by a majority that when an Act is bad on the ground of excessive delegation it is void and still-born and it cannot be revived by an amending Act seeking to remove the vice. It means that the whole Act has to be re-enacted in the modified form.214<br><br>

CHAPTER FOUR<br><br>

THE ORIGIN OF JUDICIAL REVIEW<br><br>

1 General Overview<br><br>

The doctrine of judicial review which has become a basic notion of every mocratic system was not evolved in a day. There are immensely zibutions of a vast different and a long thread of historical background behind its evolution. In the study of history, we find the general concept of the doctrine being rooted at the time of Plato and Cicero onwards. Cicero a particularly considered to have contributed to the evolution of the doctrine of judicial review. 215<br><br>

The textual, structural and historical roots of judicial review go back to the feeling on courts as the ultimate guardian of the Constitution and rights of the people. It is true that this feeling, at least in its explicit modern form, is a heritage of the seventeenth century English revolutions and of the laissez-faire economy which followed. There were a few years from 1616 to 1643- when the Stuarts and the Royal lawyers led by Bacon asserted that the King's officers were not answerable to the common law courts but only to the King's Council. This was part of what was regarded an attempt to set up an absolute non-parliamentary executive. When Lord Hilt finally established in 1700 the power to review official action by certiorari and mandamus his decision was simply one aspect of the limits set upon monarchy,216 These events ushered in along... The revolution

phasized once more the themes of a limited government and a limited executive. 217<br><br>

Constitutional practice, judicial review is usually considered to have begun with the assertion by John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United Court States in Marbury V. Madison 218 in 1803, of the power of the Supreme  to invalidate legislation enacted by Congress. There was, in fact, no  express warrant for Marshall's  219 assertion of the power of judicial review in the actual text of the Constitution, although there was some precedent it in the British Privy Council review of colonial legislation; its success rested ultimately on the Supreme Court's own ruling, plus the absence of elective political challenge to it.<br><br>

On the other hand, in the adversarial legal system the great Chief Justice of the Common Pleas of Great Britain, Sir Edward Coke tried to assert the

218. Marbury Madison (Feb. 24, 1803), landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision, the first nce in which the high court declared an act of Congress unconstitutional, thus blishing the doctrine of judicial review. The Supreme Court's growing conflict with President Jefferson and the Republican Congress came to a head after Secretary of State Madison, ort Jefferson's orders, withheld from William Marbury the commission of his appointment (March 2, 1801), by former President Adams, as justice of the peace in the Det of Columbia. Marbury-one of the "midnight appointments" under the Judiciary Act of 1801-requested the Supreme Court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling Madison to deliver his commission. In denying his request, the Court held that it lacked jurisdiction because Section 13 of the Judiciary Act passed by Congress in 1789, which authorized the Court to issue such a writ, was unconstitutional and thus invalid. Chief Justice Marshall declared that in any such conflict between the Constitution and a law passed by Congress, the Constitution must always take precedence.<br><br>

concept of the supremacy of law in Bonham's case220 in 1610, where he declared an Act of parliament void, on the ground that is was against the common right and reason. On this reason, some people argue that Coke asserted the doctrine of judicial review against legislation for the first time in the history of adversarial court practice even before the Marshall's pronouncement. However, in the post 17th century the concept of the parliamentary supremacy took place in England, and the doctrine could not root in England for a long. 221 <br><br>

The experts do not have unanimous opinions on the origins of judicial review. Some of them do agree that Marshall was the real inventor of judicial review and some other argue that there are number of examples of exercise of the power of judicial review by the USA and UK courts even before the Marbury case. Warren E. Burger writes222 it is often assumed that the doctrine was the invention of Chief Justice John Marshall in that most famous of all his opinions. It is true of course that Chief Justice Marshall first announced this keystone doctrine of a Constitutional law in the Marbury case, and it is also true that our written Constitution makes no reference to the theory in defining judicial power. The reasons for not writing it into the Constitution are speculative at best. But Marshall was not and never claimed to be the originator of the doctrine since he was well aware of a growing acceptance of the idea that Constitutional judicator was inherent in the very nature of written Constitution. This is

Dr Bonham's case: (1610), legal case decided by Sir Edward Coke, chief justice of England's Court of Common Pleas, in which he asserted the supremacy of the common law in England, noting that the prerogatives of Parliament were derived from and circumscribed by precedent. He declared that "when an act of parliament is against common right or reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it and adjudge such act to be void." Coke had already applied this doctrine to acts of the king and, in this case, was extending it to parliamentary legislation. However, the principle of judicial review of parliamentary acts implied by Bonham's Case never took hold in England, and Coke himself Seems to have later abandoned the idea. PATRICA 33 (1998).

not to disparage Marshall, for he was the one who recognized the need and enunciated the doctrine as part of federal jurisprudence. <br><br>

Before Marshall's decision the doctrine was already rooted in American a tradition, writes Sulvia Snowiss. According to her judicial review as they know it was developed over three distinct periods in the USA namely:<br><br>

1. From independence to federalist 78 <br><br>
2. Federalist 78 to Marbury<br><br>

3. From Marbury to the end of Marshall's tenure of the court. <br><br>

During the first period judicial authority over unconstitutional acts was often claimed, but its legitimacy was just as often denied. In this unresolved controversy, judicial invalidation of legislation remained an essentially controversial practice. The judicial authority to enforce the Constitution asserted in period 1 was understood to be an extraordinary political act, a judicial substitute for revolution. Period 1 judges were closer to outdated English precedent than subsequent American doctrine, 224<br><br>

Period 2 provided the coherent defense of judicial authority over unconstitutional legislation that had been absent in period 1. It was presented first by James Iredell in a North Carolina newspaper in 1786 and reformulated and popularized by Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 78 and James Wilson in 'Lectures on the Law'. Period 2 judicial review, first, was not derived from the written Constitution, but from the existence in the American states of real, explicit social contracts or fundamental law, which came into being in the aftermath of the revolutionary break from England. Next, period 2 judicial review maintained the period 1 understanding that judicial enforcement of the Constitution was an extraordinary political act, a judicial substitute for revolution. Period 2

Judicial review, furthermore, derived its authority over legislation from equality of the government branches under explicit fundamental law, not, does the Marbury doctrine, from a uniquely judicial responsibility to a written Constitution. Last, its exercise was accomplished by political restraints appropriate for judicial defense of fundamental law. 225 <br><br>

Period 3 began with Marshall's assumption of the chief justiceships and consisted of his reworking of the period 2 position. In this period, Marshall, first, ended seriatim opinion writing and, with it, public airing of alternate approaches to fundamental law. Next, under this near monopoly of opinion writing, he introduced an unprecedented application to the Constitution of the rules for statutory interpretation, an application not to be found in period 2 cases or in the court, concurring, or dissenting opinions of his Supreme Court colleagues. Last, he affected a seemingly slight but portentous shift in the significance to be attributed to the written Constitution. In Marshall's hands the written Constitution lost its period 2 meaning as vehicle of explicit fundamental law and became instead testimony to the Constitution's status as supreme ordinary law.<br><br>

Likewise, in 1793, ten years before Marshall's decision in Marbury v. Madison, Spence Roane, a great judge of the Virginia court in Kamper v. Hawkins (1793) observed that the legislation is no longer fixed if the legislative infringes the Constitution of Virginia227. This statement held in Kamper sands that justice Spence was seeking to establish the doctrine of judicial review in the Constitution.

Sen the US Supreme Court, before Marshall, purported to exercise the power of judicial review though no laws were ever invalidated. A prime example is Hayburn's Case, 2 US (2 Dall.) 408, 1 L. Ed. 436 (1792), which concerned a statute empowering federal and state courts to determine the propriety and amount of pensions for disabled veterans of the Revolutionary War. The statute provided for the Secretary of War to review the court decision and transmit his opinion to Congress, which could, if it agreed, appropriate the necessary funds. The Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania refused to consider William Hayburn's application for a pension under the statute, and the Attorney General sought a writ of mandamus in the Supreme Court. Prior to the decision, Congress avoided a Constitutional confrontation by amending the legislation to provide other relief for the pensioners, and the Supreme Court dismissed on grounds of moot ness.230 Similarly, in Hollingsworth v. Virginia, 3 US (3 Dall.) 378, 381 & n. 1 L. Ed. 644 (1798), the supreme court refused to declare the 11º amendment unconstitutional on the grounds that the President had not signed the resolution proposing the amendment to the state, 231 <br><br>

The first case in which the supreme court held a state statute (in Marbury the statute of Congress i.e. section 13 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was declared void) unconstitutional was in Fletcher v. Peck, 10 US (6 Crach) 87,3 L. Ed. 162 (1810), but the case came to the supreme court from the US circuit court for the district of Massachusetts, not from a state court. Chief Justice Marshall held that a state law of Georgia impaired the obligation of contracts.232 <br><br>

Mhe Martin (1816), the Supreme Court held in Cohens u. Virginia, 19 US wheat 264, 5 L Ed. 257 (1821), that it also had jurisdiction under section 25 of the Judiciary Act to review state criminal proceedings. The court, speaking again through Chief Justice Marshall, held that the eventh amendment did not apply when suit was instituted by the state rather than by a non-citizen against a state, and that the fact that a state was a party to the suit was no objection to the court's exercise of its jurisdiction 234  <br><br>

we see, therefore, that long before Marbury American political leaders, including many of the most distinguished lawyers and judges in the colonies and in the original thirteen states, accepted it as fundamental that a written Constitution was a restraint on every part of the federal government. It does not disparage John Marshall's greatness as a judge or a statesman to say that when he wrote the opinion in Marbury he was doing little more than declaring what was widely accepted by so many of the best legal minds of his day- at least when they could divorce politics from reason! If it had not come in Marbury it would have come later but John Marshall was not a man to wait for perfect opportunities if a plausible one offered itself. It had to be said, and Marbury was the fortuitous circumstance that made it possible to establish this great principle early in our history. 235 <br><br>

In addition to the practices of USA and UK, a number of the Constitutions drafted in other parts of Europe and Asia after World War II incorporated judicial review in various forms: in France, where the Cour de Cassation, the Supreme Court, has no power of judicial review, a Constitutional committee of mixed judicial-legislative character was established; Germany and Italy provided more directly for special Constitutional courts; Japan, India, and Pakistan set up supreme courts exercising

judicial review on the general United States and British Commonwealth pattern.<br><br>

Widespread pressures after World War II for the adoption of judicial review stemmed from the feeling, strongly influenced by U.S. Constitutional ideas, that a system of Constitutional checks and balances is an essential condition of democratic government. Some observers concluded that the concentration of government power in the executive, substantially unchecked by other agencies of government, contributed to the rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and Japan in the era between World War I and World War II.<br><br>

The experience of judicial review in some other countries has shown a tendency to favour economic and property interests, accompanied by a firm insistence that the judges' task is one of interpretation alone. Germany, on the other hand, has adopted the judicial activism of its American model.<br><br>

4. 2 Experience of the USA<br><br>

As observed in above extracts, the doctrine of judicial review is considered as an integral part of the American judicial and Constitutional process although the Constitution does not explicitly mention the same in any provision236. However, it is believed that judicial review is itself a product of judicial construction in the USA. The Supreme Court argued in the Marbury case that because the Constitution is the supreme law of the land (it says as much in Article VI) and because it is the province of the judiciary of Congress are inconsistent with a provision of the Constitution, the to uphold the law, it follows that, when state laws and even acts former must yield to the latter and must be declared void by the courts. The same principle holds, of course, with regard to executive action contrary to the Constitution. Supreme Court pronouncements on

of Constitutionality are final and binding for all other courts and questions governmental authorities, state and federal.<br><br>

Although people would have different opinions with regard to origins of judicial review, they would agree that judicial review was given a Constitutional foundation for the first time in the American Constitution in 1787. And, it was the American Supreme Court which asserted the power of judicial review of legislation speaking through Chief Justice Marshall in Marbury by exercising the Constitution.<br><br>

Martin Shapire observes238 judicial review of the Constitutionality of statutes is a peculiarly American phenomenon, which has been copied with varying degrees of success by other nation also. According to other jurist Richard Mofstadter239 judicial review is a limitation on popular Government and is a fundamental part of the Constitutional scheme of America. It is also an ultimate source of all political authority in America240<br><br>

238. Marbury v. Madison, (1803) 5 U. S. 137. The view of Marshall enunciated in the case of Marbury can be summarized as follows: the Constitution is a written document clearly defining and limiting the powers of Government; the Constitution is a fundamental law and is superior to all ordinary laws; a legislative Act contrary to the Constitution is void and is not a law and, therefore, it cannot bind the courts and panties; it is always the duty of the court to decide the conflict between the two laws; if a legislative Act is in conflict with the Constitution it is the duty and obligation of the court to refuse to apply such legislative Act, if the court shirks or fails in refusing to declare such unconstitutional law void, the foundation of all the written Constitution would fail; and voiding the legislative Act is not the act of judicial supremacy but is a judicial necessity etc.<br><br>

4. 2.1 The Constitutional Bases<br><br>

The USA Constitution was written during the summer of 1787 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. by 55 delegates to a Constitutional Convention that was called ostensibly to amend the Articles of Confederation (1781-89), the country's first written Constitution. The Constitution was the product of political compromise after long and often rancorous debates over issues such as states' rights, representation, and slavery. Delegates from small and large states disagreed over whether the number of representatives in the new federal legislature should be the same for each state-as was the case under the Articles of Confederation or different depending on a state's population. In addition, some delegates from Northern states sought to abolish slavery or, failing that, to make representation dependent on the size of a state's free population. At the same time, some Southern delegates threatened to abandon the convention if their demands to keep slavery and the slave trade legal and to count slaves for representation purposes were not met. Eventually the framers resolved their disputes by adopting a proposal put forward by the Connecticut delegation. The Great Compromise, as it came to be known. created a bicameral legislature with a Senate, in which all states would be equally represented, and a House of Representatives, in which representation would be apportioned on the basis of a state's free population plus three-fifths of its slave population. (The inclusion of the slave population was known separately as the three-fifths compromise.) A further compromise on slavery prohibited Congress from banning the importation of slaves until 1808 (Article I, Section 9). After all the disagreements were bridged, the new Constitution was submitted for ratification to the 13 states on September 28, 1787. In 1787-88, in an effort to persuade New York to ratify the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, John Jay, and James Madison published a series of essays on the Constitution and republican government in New York newspapers. Their work, written under the pseudonym "Publius" and collected and published in book form as The Federalist (1788), became a classic

exposition and defense of the Constitution. In June 1788, after the Constitution had been ratified by nine states (as required by Article VII), Congress set March 4, 1789, as the date for the new government to commence proceedings (the first elections under the Constitution were held late in 1788). Because ratification in many states was contingent on the promised addition of a Bill of Rights, Congress proposed 12 amendments in September 1789; 10 were ratified by the states, and their adoption was certified on December 15, 1791. (One of the original 12 proposed amendments, which prohibited midterm changes in compensation for members of Congress, was ratified in 1992 as the Twenty-seventh Amendment. The last one, concerning the ratio of citizens per member of the House of Representatives, has never been adopted.)<br><br>

The authors of the Constitution were heavily influenced by the country's experience under the Articles of Confederation, which had attempted to retain as much independence and sovereignty for the states as possible and to assign to the central government only those nationally important functions that the states could not handle individually. But the events of the years 1781 to 1787, including the national government's inability to act during Shay's Rebellion (1786-87) in Massachusetts, showed that the Articles were unworkable because they deprived the national government of many essential powers, including direct taxation and the ability to regulate interstate commerce. It was hoped that the new Constitution would remedy this problem.<br><br>

The framers of the Constitution were especially concerned with limiting the power of government and securing the liberty of citizens. The doctrine of legislative, executive, and judicial separation of powers, the checks and balances of each branch against the others, and the explicit guarantees of individual liberty were all designed to strike a balance between authority and liberty-the central purpose of American Constitutional law. <br><br>

140





The Constitution concisely organizes the country's basic political institutions. The main text comprises seven articles. Article 1 vests all legislative powers in the Congress-the House of Representatives and the Senate. The Great Compromise stipulated that representation in the House would be based on population, and each state is entitled to two senators. Members of the House serve terms of two years, senators terms of six. Among the powers delegated to Congress are the right to levy taxes, borrow money, regulate interstate commerce, provide for military forces, declare war, and determine member seating and rules of procedure. The House initiates impeachment proceedings, and the Senate adjudicates them.<br><br>

Article II vests executive power in the office of the presidency of the United States. The president, selected by an electoral college to serve a four-year term, is given responsibilities common to chief executives, including serving as commander in chief of the armed forces, negotiating treaties (two-thirds of the Senate must concur), and granting pardons. The president's vast appointment powers, which include members of the federal judiciary and the cabinet, are subject to the "advice and consent" (majority approval) of the Senate (Article II, Section 2). Originally presidents were eligible for continual reelection, but the Twenty-second Amendment (1951) later prohibited any person from being elected president more than twice. Although the formal powers of the president are Constitutionally quite limited and vague in comparison with those of the Congress, a variety of historical and technological factors-such as the centralization of power in the executive branch during war and the advent of television-have increased the informal responsibilities of the office extensively to embrace other aspects of political leadership, including proposing legislation to Congress.<br><br>

Article III places judicial power in the hands of the courts. 241. The Constitution is interpreted by the courts, and the Supreme Court of the

United States is the final court of appeal from the state and lower federal courts. The power of American courts to rule on the Constitutionality of laws, known as judicial review, is held by few other courts in the world and is not explicitly granted in the Constitution. The principle of judicial review was first asserted by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury v. Madison (1803), when the court ruled that it had the authority to void national or state laws.<br><br>

Beyond the body of judicial rulings interpreting it, the Constitution acquires meaning in a broader sense at the hands of all who use it. Congress on innumerable occasions has given new scope to the document through statutes, such as those creating executive departments, the federal courts, territories, and states; controlling succession to the presidency; and setting up the executive budget system. The chief executive also has contributed to Constitutional interpretation, as in the development of the executive agreement as an instrument of foreign policy. Practices outside the letter of the Constitution based on custom and usage are often recognized as Constitutional elements; they include the system of political parties, presidential nomination procedures, and the conduct of election campaigns. The presidential cabinet is largely a Constitutional "convention" based on custom, and the actual operation of the Electoral College system is also a convention.<br><br>

Article IV deals, in part, with relations between the states and privileges of the citizens of the states. These provisions include the full faith and credit clause, which requires states to recognize the official acts and judicial proceedings of other states; the requirement that each state provide citizens from other states with all the privileges and immunities afforded the citizens of that state; and the guarantee of a republican form of government for each state.<br><br>

Article V stipulates the procedures for amending the Constitution. Amendments maybe proposed by a two-thirds vote of both houses of

142



Congress or by a convention called by Congress on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states. Proposed amendments must be ratified by three-fourths of the state legislatures or by conventions in as many states, depending on the decision of Congress. All subsequent amendments have been proposed by Congress, and all but one-the Twenty-first Amendment, which repealed prohibition-have been ratified by state legislatures.<br><br>

Article VI, which prohibits religious tests for officeholders, also deals with public debts and the supremacy of the Constitution, citing the document as the supreme Law of the Land...any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." Article VII stipulated that the Constitution would become operational after being ratified by nine states.<br><br>

The national government has only those Constitutional powers that are delegated to it either expressly or by implication; the states, unless otherwise restricted, possess all the remaining powers (Tenth Amendment). Thus, national powers are enumerated (Article I, Section 8, paragraphs 1-17), and state powers are not. The state powers are often called residual, or reserved, powers. The elastic, or necessary and proper, clause (Article I, Section 8, and paragraph 18) states that Congress shall have the authority "To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution" the various powers vested in the national government. Thus, it follows that, in addition to the delegated powers, Congress possesses implied powers, a proposition established by Chief Justice Marshall in McCulloch v. Maryland (1819). The issue of national Versus state power was not fully resolved by this decision, however, and many political battles in American history-including debates on nullification, slavery, racial segregation, and abortion-often have been disputes over Constitutional interpretations of implied and residual powers.<br><br>

143



Competing concepts of federal supremacy and states' rights were brought into sharp relief in questions about commercial regulation. The commerce clause simply authorized Congress "To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes." Particularly since a series of decisions in 1937, the court has interpreted Congress's regulatory power broadly under the commerce clause as new methods of interstate transportation and communication have come into use. States may not regulate any aspect of interstate commerce that Congress has preempted.<br><br>

On the basis of the above noted provision of the Constitution, the federal supreme court of the U.S.A. has decided a number of cases by exercising the power of judicial review of legislation.

of congress been declared unconstitutional and refused enforcement by the Supreme Court.243 <br><br>

In the U.S. system of judicial review, Constitutional questions can be raised only in connection with actual "cases and controversies." Advisory opinions to the government are not rendered by the courts. Although the requirements to litigate cases have been relaxed by the Supreme Court, the rule still is that courts will not decide a Constitutional question unless it is rooted in a controversy in which the parties have a direct, personal interest; this can sometimes frustrate efforts to obtain pronouncements on disputed issues. In the American system courts, moreover, are the guardians of the Constitution, but they are not bound to consider all the provisions of the Constitution justiciable. Under the doctrine of "political questions" the Supreme Court has refused at times to apply standards prescribed by or deducible from the Constitution to issues that it believed could be better decided by the political branches of government. For instance, Article IV, 4, provides that the states must have a republican form of government. Since Luther v. Borden (1849) it is settled that the court will not use the provision to invalidate state laws; it is for Congress and the president to decide whether a particular state government is republican in form. Many military and foreign policy questions, such as the question of the Constitutionality of a particular war, have been likewise considered political and therefore non-justiciable.<br><br>

243. The objects of judicial Review in America are; to declare the laws unconstitutional which are not in conformity with the Constitution; to defend the valid laws, which are, challenged to be unconstitutional; to protect and uphold the Constitution by interpreting its provisions as to apply to the changing condition of life; to save the legislative function of congress being encroached by other departments of the Government; to check the action of congress and the state legislative from delegating the essential legislative functions to the executive or the check congress from delegating its legislative function to the state legislative.

145



In the first half of the 19th century the Supreme Court succeeded in reinforcing the newly born structures of the federal system by interpreting generously those provisions of the Constitution that concern federal judicial power and those that set limitations on the states powers to regulate interstate commerce. Later, when Congress began to enact laws intended to regulate some aspects of the nation's economic processes, the court was very cautious in granting the necessary powers. Up to the New Deal years (1932-37), the court, while admitting several federal regulatory interventions, also ruled that some economic relations, such as labour relations, lay almost entirely outside the scope of the commerce clause the clause that gives Congress the power to regulate "commerce among the states") and were therefore matters exclusively for state legislation. After 1937 the court lifted the obstacles it had previously erected to federal interventions in the economic and social transactions of the nation. Today. under the new interpretation of the commerce clause laid down in such decisions as Wickard v. Filburn(1942) and under the doctrine of the federal spending power first enunciated in U.S. v. Butler (1936), Congress can make laws with respect to practically all subjects it deems of national relevance and in need of regulation from the centre.<br><br>

In the area of separation of federal powers the court has countenanced in the course of time a transfer of powers to the executive and to administrative agencies that probably was not envisaged by the Founding Fathers. Because all legislative powers are conferred by Article 1, 1, of the Constitution upon Congress, the court at first ruled that such powers cannot be delegated by Congress to the executive. This doctrine was much diluted in the 20th century when it became clear that delegated legislation was necessary to govern a system of mixed economy. The court's attitude favourable to a reinforcement of the executive within the Constitutional system has manifested itself also in other respects, notably in the field of foreign affairs. But the court has been able also to draw boundaries to an excessive expansion of the presidency. It has ruled that the president cannot, under the pretext of an emergency, disregard rules of conduct

146





prescribed by Congress precisely for the circumstances of the case (Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 1952). It has established that the prerogative of the president to keep confidential statements secret must yield to the need of the judiciary to enforce criminal justice if the secret does not relate strictly to military or diplomatic matters (Nixon v. US., 1973).<br><br>

Until the New Deal the court used the provisions of the Constitution concerning individual rights primarily to protect property and economic liberties. That use helped to preserve a system of laissez-faire economy against state and federal efforts to interfere with the market. In particular, the "due process" clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth amendments (no person shall be deprived of "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law") were often employed by the court to invalidate social legislation (Lochner v. New York, 1905; Adair v. U.S., 1908). In the second half of the 20th century the posture of the court has changed entirely. The court today seldom concerns itself with economic liberties. It is engaged rather in protecting citizens' non-economic freedoms as well as their equality before the law, focusing on issues such as civil and political rights, procedural rights in the criminal and administrative processes, or the right to privacy. In the course of developing this new jurisprudence the court has declared unconstitutional segregation in the schools (Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, 1954) and mal-apportionment in electoral districts (Baker v. Carr, 1962; Wesberry v. Sanders, 1964); it has defended the rights of the suspect and of the accused (Mapp v. Ohio, 1961; Miranda V. Arizona, 1966); it has liberalized voluntary abortion (Roe v. Wade, 1973)<br><br>

Viewed in the light of its two-century performance, U.S. judicial review can be assessed as an institution that defends the values of the political ideology prevailing in a given historical period against by and large Occasional deviations from them on the part of the political branches of government. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, for example, the

147



ideal of the minimal state and of a self-governing market was dominant with the elites of the Western world, and the Supreme Court did its best to enforce it in the peculiar context of the U.S. political system. At present the court is dedicated to furthering the values of the currently dominant ideal of a democracy: a system in which the equality and the non economic freedoms of persons are recognized and the state possesses all the necessary means to regulate the economy. Conflicts between the court and the political powers, state and federal, have occurred, but they have never been sharp except occasionally under particular circumstances: in the difficult years following the establishment of the new federal government and in the years of the Civil War; in the phase of transition from one to the other dominant political ideal (the New Deal years) and in the 1950s and 1960s, when the federal and state governments were seriously lagging behind in reshaping the legal system in accordance with fundamental requirements of the new democratic model.<br><br>

4.2.2 Civil liberties and the Bill of Rights<br><br>

The federal government is obliged by many Constitutional provisions to respect the individual citizen's basic rights. Some civil liberties were specified in the original document, notably in the provisions guaranteeing the writ of habeas corpus and trial by jury in criminal cases (Article III. Section 2) and forbidding bills of attainder and ex post facto laws (Article I, Section 9). But the most significant limitations to government's power over the individual were added in 1791 in the Bill of Rights. The Constitution's First Amendment guarantees the rights of conscience, such as freedom of religion, speech, and the press, and the right of peaceful assembly and petition. Other guarantees in the Bill of Rights require fair procedures for persons accused of a crime-such as protection against unreasonable search and seizure, compulsory self-incrimination, double jeopardy, and excessive bail-and guarantees of a speedy and public trial by a local, impartial jury before an impartial judge and representation by counsel. Rights of private property are also guaranteed. Although the Bill of Rights

148



is a broad expression of individual civil liberties, the ambiguous wording of many of its provisions-such as the Second Amendment's right "to keep and bear arms" and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of "cruel and unusual punishments"-has been a source of Constitutional controversy and intense political debate. Further, the rights guaranteed are not absolute, and there has been considerable disagreement about the extent to which they limit governmental authority. The Bill of Rights originally protected citizens only from the national government. For example, although the Constitution prohibited the establishment of an official religion at the national level, the official state-supported religion of Massachusetts was Congregationalism until 1833. Thus, individual citizens had to look to state Constitutions for protection of their rights against state governments.<br><br>

4.2.3 The Fourteenth Amendment<br><br>

After the American Civil War, three new Constitutional amendments were adopted: the Thirteenth, which abolished slavery; the Fourteenth, which granted citizenship to former slaves; and the Fifteenth, which guaranteed former male slaves the right to vote. The Fourteenth Amendment placed an important federal limitation on the states by forbidding them to deny to any person "life, liberty, or property, without due process of law and guaranteeing every person within a state's jurisdiction "the equal protection of its laws." Later interpretations by the Supreme Court in the 20th century gave these two clauses added significance. In Gitlow v. New. York (1925), the due process clause was interpreted by the Supreme Court to broaden the applicability of the Bill of Rights' protection of speech to the states, holding both levels of government to the same Constitutional standard. During subsequent decades, the Supreme Court selectively applied the due process clause to protect other liberties guaranteed in the Bill of Rights, including freedom of religion and the press and guarantees of a fair trial, including the defendant's right to an impartial judge and the assistance of counsel. Most controversial was the Supreme Court's

149




application of this due process clause to the Roe v. Wade case, which led to the legalization of abortion in 1973. 244<br><br>

The Supreme Court applied the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in its landmark decision in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954), in which it ruled that racial segregation in public schools unconstitutional. In the 1960s and 70s the equal protection clause was used by the Supreme Court to extend protections to other areas, was including zoning laws, voting rights, and gender discrimination. The broad interpretation of this clause has also caused considerable controversy.<br><br>

4.2.4 The Constitution as a Living Document<br><br>

Twenty-seven amendments have been added to the Constitution since 1789. In addition to those mentioned above, other far-reaching amendments include the Sixteenth (1913), which allowed Congress to impose an income tax; the Seventeenth (1913), which provided for direct election of senators; the Nineteenth (1920), which mandated woman suffrage; and the Twenty-sixth (1971), which granted suffrage to citizens 18 years of age and older,245<br><br>

In more than two centuries of operation, the United States Constitution has proved itself a dynamic document. It has served as a model for other countries, its provisions being widely imitated in national Constitutions throughout the world. Although the Constitution's brevity and ambiguity have sometimes led to serious disputes about its meaning, they also have made it adaptable to changing historical circumstances and ensured its relevance in ages far removed from the one in which it was written

The formative period for the origins of judicial review in England was the seventeenth century that in the famous Dr. Bonham's case, Coke, then Chief Justice of Common Pleas, allowed Dr. Bonham to bring an action for false imprisonment against the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons This college by royal character and statute was authorized to regulate the practice of medicine, and it had imprisoned Dr. Bonham for contempt. Coke held that the facts underlying Dr. Bonham's alleged misconduct could be tried by the court; otherwise he would have no remedy against unauthorized power 247 Significance of this case was that the court held the common-law courts did have jurisdiction to test the validity of official action.<br><br>

In 1614, Coke and others of the justices declared the levies to be invalid, fining and imprisoning the recalcitrant commissioners.24 in the meantime, in one of the most remarkable developments in the history of common-law, the development of the writ of mandamus was taking place. It was in 1615, Coke created the rationale on which mandamus was later based practically out of whole cloth in the famous and mysterious James Bagge's Case 249 In 1642, the writ of certiorari was used in Commins v.

246. 8 Coke 113b, 17 Eng. Rep. 646 (C. P. 1610) Coke asserted that if an act of parliament is against common right and reason, or repugnant, or impossible to be performed, the common law will control it, and adjudge such act to be void. This was a milestone judgment in inventing the judicial review of legislative act for the first time in the Constitutional history at was not necessary to their thinking that the courts be independent of parliament in any absolute sense or that they have the power to invalidate legislation but it was enough at that time that legislation would be interpreted in the light of reason and common-law, that official action would be subject to legal control, and that the authority of the courts would be accepted by parliament and crown.( See also Jaffe,op cit..at 333)

Massam 250 In those days the scope of review was indeed limited to the question of jurisdiction. Lord Holt in the case of Cardiffe Bridge in 1700 asserted the authority to issue certiorari or mandamus to every jurisdiction, and in the thinking of that time jurisdiction retained a good deal of the breadth which it had in the Middle Ages. It is also believed that Lord Holt finally worked out their concept of judicial review in England.22 The whole structure of idea is present in Lord Holt's judgments in the case of Cardiffe Bridge (1700) and in Dr. Groenvelt v. Burwell (1699) where any court is erected by statute, a certiorari lies to it, and in Holt's view all agencies empowered to affect property rights are courts. It is immaterial that the statute does not give authority to the court to issue certiorari; it is by the common law that this court will examine, if other courts exceed their jurisdictions. 253 <br><br>

A series of cases in the years 1700-1740 developed the principle that mandamus would not lay when the respondent's function was judicial but only when it was ministerial.<br><br>

The judicial review regarding legislative Acts, in particular, was prevalent for sometimes in England. It had the heritage of inklings of Magna Charta (1215) and the Cokeian theory of common right and reason. Chief Justice Coke gave a great impetus to this doctrine254. The law, which was against public sentiment and common morality and did not appeal to the common right and reason, was void. The American Constitutional writer Corwin is of the view that the initial source of Judicial Review is found in Bonham's case decided by chief justice Coke which was decided in England in

1610. De Smith's writes once in England, there was a try to establish a Constitutional council to review the legality of assembly measures. He further says Judicial Review in Eng. has significant roots in history. Justice Hobert also said the same. In his word "Even an act of parliament made against natural equity, as to make a man judge in his own case is void in itselfs6, But in England its extinction came when the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy established that the court has no power to determine the legality of parliamentary enactments. The main reasons for the absence of Judicial Review in England may be as follows;<br><br>

. The evolution of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy.<br><br>

. Absence of fundamental rights.<br><br>

.

Existence of unwritten Constitution<br><br>

Growing conservatism of the Eng people and faith in the

decision of the majority<br><br>

. Members of parliament such as members of the House of

Lords taking part in the judicial administration. <br><br>

⚫ Unitary form of government centralizing all powers.<br><br>

Ambition of the Eng. people to make the electorate more conscious and alert so as to choose good representatives.<br><br>

• The broad consciousness of the Eng. people to make

parliament to work in the spirit of national harmony. <br><br>

Predominating influence of the public opinion on parliamentary activities.<br><br>

• Making of the Constitution and the ordinary laws by the same

body. I.e. the parliament.<br><br>

Nowadays there is a possibility of a conflict between the doctrine of the supremacy of common law and that of the sovereignty of parliament when the U.K. entered the European Community in 1973. Furthermore, the

courts have now accepted that, as a matter or national law, parliament to power to infringe community law. If possible, of course, that legislation will be construed so as to be compatible with community law has but an Act of parliament that cannot be so interpreted will not be Appliedass <br><br>

The principle is not new, but, encouraged by the design of a specialized procedure, judicial review has been a growth industry since 1970s and has assumed greater prominence in public law.<br><br>
4.4 Judicial Review in Europe and Elsewhere<br><br>

In Europe and other parts of the world the idea of making the judiciary guardian of the Constitution was adopted much later than in the United States, as a rule only in the 20th century. While adopting it, however, some European countries introduced a variant on the U.S. model. Instead of letting any court pass on the Constitutionality of statutes with the Supreme Court having the final say, as in the United States, they chose to set up a special Constitutional court to which all questions concerning the validity of legislation must be referred and which alone has the power to declare statutes unconstitutional. In continental Europe judges are usually career functionaries; it was thought that the delicate task of invalidating legislation would be better performed by a court whose members were appointed directly either by parliament or, in part, by the president of the republic, the executive, the highest ordinary courts, and so forth.<br><br>

The U.S. system of judicial review is "decentralized"; whereas the system based on a special Constitutional court is "centralized." Austria was the first to inaugurate the centralized system (1920). After World War II it was adopted by Italy (1948) and West Germany (1949). Constitutional courts are at work today also in Spain, Portugal, and Turkey. In European

257. Finer et al, op. cit, at 46.

154





centralized systems Constitutional questions concerning the validity of statutory law reach the court chiefly through references by the ordinary courts engaged in deciding cases or through appeals by the losing parties of ordinary courts' decisions depriving them of their Constitutional rights. But sometimes the questions can be raised also by such political agencies as the national executive and the regional governments or by a parliamentary minority. These can attack the law before the Constitutional court without having to sue in an ordinary court. In certain instances the centralized method probably makes judicial settlement of Constitutional issues easier and quicker than in the United States. And the American doctrine of "political questions" does not seem to have found reception, at least as such, in the jurisprudence of European centralized systems. Besides adjudging the validity of statutory law, European Constitutional courts usually must also resolve conflicts between state agencies (the legislature, the executive, the president of the republic, and the judiciary) dispute about their respective Constitutional prerogatives. In addition, they may sit as judge in trials upon impeachments and dispose of other matters of Constitutional import.<br><br>

Since 1958 France has had a Constitutional Council, which, though not a true court, can set aside unconstitutional statutes before they are promulgated, upon petition by the president of the republic or by the prime minister, the chairman of either of the two legislative assemblies, or a parliamentary minority.<br><br>

The U.S. system of judicial review by ordinary courts has been adopted. sometimes with partial modification, by several states both in Europe and elsewhere, including Ireland (1937), Greece (1975), Japan (1946), India (1950), Mexico (1917), Brazil (1946), and Argentina (1949). It has been in operation in Switzerland, with some limitations, since 1874. It was introduced in Canada in 1867 and in Australia in 1900 and is presently an important feature of their Constitutions.<br><br>

155




Communist countries, with the exception of Yugoslavia, do not admit judicial review in their Constitutions. The reason adduced is that it would undermine the unity of political powers and the sovereignty of the people as interpreted by the legislature. Hungary in 1984 and Poland in 1985 set O Constitutional councils, which, however, serve in practice only as up consultative organs for the legislature.<br><br>

4.4.1 Trends of Judicial Review in Europe<br><br>

Constitutional courts and supreme courts exercising judicial review outside the United States are often less politically influential than their American counterpart. Nevertheless, judicial review, wherever it is at work, has become an element of at least some weight in the Constitutional processes of the state, and it tends in general to advance the same democratic values that have inspired the decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court since the 1930s.<br><br>

European Constitutional courts, in particular, have been able to correct here and there the legal system of their countries by reading the bill of rights present in their respective Constitutions in ways that bear comparison with the American experience of judicial review. Sometimes, of course, the trends of decisions diverge on special points, but the general direction seems to be the same. It may be remarked, however, that European courts have often been more cautious than the U.S. Supreme Court in expanding the freedoms of the individual at the expense of other competing values. A few examples will suffice.<br><br>

In the area of freedom of expression the American doctrine of "clear and present danger," as restated in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969), implies that no seditious or subversive speech can be punished unless it constitutes an incitement to immediate unlawful action and the incitement is likely to produce, in the circumstances, such action. The freedom to express unorthodox opinions is clearly recognized by European Constitutions and

156





is upheld by the Constitutional courts when they are confronted with laws that curtail it. The doctrine of clear and present danger, however, has not been adopted by them. The Italian Constitutional court requires, for the punishment of speech advocating the use of violence, that the speech create, in the circumstances, a "danger," but it does not specify that the danger must be "immediate." The West German Constitutional court, Judging on the basis of Constitutional provisions that forbid speech directed at impairing the liberal-democratic foundations of the state and associations pursuing the same goal dissolved in the 1950s a neo-Nazi and a Communist party without considering the element of actual "danger" relevant. Later it countenanced, on the same basis, laws excluding from public employment persons holding subversive beliefs. In the United States the law of libel concerning public figures actively protects free speech inasmuch as, under the doctrine of New York Times v. Sullivan (1964), plaintiffs cannot win unless they prove that the libeler acted with "special malice" (i.e., knowingly asserted the false). No special malice is constitutionally required in Europe to find liability in cases of defamation of public figures.<br><br>

The U.S. Supreme Court found in Roe v. Wade that a woman is entitled by the Constitution to obtain an abortion freely, after consultation with a doctor in the first trimester of pregnancy and in unauthorized clinic in the second trimester. No European Constitutional court has gone that far in recognizing freedom of abortion as part of the woman's right to privacy. The Italian court held in 1975 that voluntary abortions cannot be punished if performed in view of saving the life and health, both physical and emotional, of the woman. The Austrian court (1974) and the French Constitutional Council (1975), without tackling the problem of a woman's Constitutional right to interrupt pregnancy, have validated statutes that provide in liberal terms for the possibility of voluntary abortions. The West German court, instead, quite alone in Europe, ruled in 1975 that the Constitution, by declaring the life of persons inviolable, implicitly wants also the life of fetuses protected and that an adequate protection is

157




afforded by the state only if voluntary abortion is made a crime by law. But the law of East Germany was much more permissive, and, a few years after the reunification of the two German states (1990), the Constitutional Court, while reaffirming that on principle the fetus must be protected, held that the protection must be achieved not by punishing but by counseling and other measures aimed at influencing a woman to decide freely to carry her pregnancy to term.<br><br>

The US Supreme Court considers the teaching of religion and even praying in public schools unconstitutional (Engel v. Vitale, 1962) Separation of church and state, although contemplated in principle also by European Constitutions, is sometimes tempered by Constitutional provisions making accords between church and state possible in matters of common interest. No European court has found that accords giving students the opportunity to attend religious courses in public schools violate the principle of religious freedom or the principle of the equality of all citizens before the law.<br><br>

In other areas of the law European Constitutional courts have proved to be as ready as, and sometimes even more ready than, the U.S. court to afford protection of the rights of the individual. In the United States Mapp v. Ohio established that illegally obtained evidence cannot be produced at a trial to substantiate criminal charges against the defendant. This "exclusionary rule" is in force at least partially also on much of the European continent. The Italian Constitutional court has stated that it is required on Constitutional grounds. Miranda v. Arizona ruled that a confession made by an accused under arrest cannot be used as evidence unless the accused has been previously advised of his rights, among which is the right to consult with a lawyer. The Italian Constitutional court has declared unconstitutional (1970) a law that excluded the suspect's attorney at the interrogation by the investigatory authorities and at other proceedings intended to secure evidence against the suspect.<br><br>

158



Although as a rule courts in the United States can be asked to pass on the lawfulness of administrative action, the Supreme Court is still reluctant to establish as a matter of Constitutional due process that citizens are always entitled to sue in court in order to have administrative decisions set aside if contrary to ordinary substantive or procedural rules. The Italian and German Constitutions explicitly state the principle without admitting of any exception, and the courts of both countries carefully see to it that the principle is respected and that citizens are not deprived of their day in court even if the other party is the administration.<br><br>

While applying the principle of equality in cases of sex discrimination and discrimination against illegitimate children, European courts have often displayed an activism superior to that of the U.S. Supreme Court in the same areas. The West German court, for instance, ruled in the 1970s that husband and wife must have the same rights within the family and that, in particular, parental power over the children belongs equally to both, the law not being permitted to prefer the husband's will in case of divergences of opinions; and this has remained the legal principle in force also in unified Germany. The Italian court has in many respects reshaped family law in order to ensure the equal rights of the wife and of children born out of wedlock. It has also defended the right of women to a treatment equal to that of men in labour relations. Effective legislative protection against discrimination of non-European immigrant workers and their families is still deficient in EU countries, and by and large Constitutional courts have said little in this area. But they have shown in general remarkable sensitivity when the problem affects local ethnic or linguistic minorities. The U.S. Supreme Court, after having declared segregation unconstitutional, found that programs of "affirmative action" meant to help minorities to rise from their lower position in society did not constitute "reverse discrimination" even if they included some privileges in the access to university education (University of California v. Bakke, 1978) and in the conservation of jobs. A ruling analogous to this has come from the Italian court with regard to the treatment of the German-speaking

159



population of Alto Adige. The court in the 1970s validated laws that provided for reserved "quotas" in public employment and publicly financed housing with a view of preserving the integrity of that linguistic group in the region they had inhabited for centuries.<br><br>

It is true that thus far European courts have never openly defied the political powers of the state in the way the U.S. Supreme Court has sometimes done. Even when the European courts have somehow challenged such powers by annulling laws that were supposedly of special interest to them, the conflict has not really been acute. But the greater prudence of European courts is not difficult to explain. It depends on many causes, prominent among which are the facts that their legitimacy as independent and active agencies within the political system is recent and that the tradition of judicial review doesn't yet have in Europe the firm roots it possesses in the United States.<br><br>

4.5. Transnational Judicial Review<br><br>

Judicial review has also transcended the boundaries of the national state. All western European states except Finland have ratified a convention on civil and political rights, first signed in 1950. On the basis of the convention a commission was organized in Strasbourg, Fr., to which individuals can appeal against actions of a member state that violate rights protected by the convention. The commission and a member state can ultimately refer the issue to a court, the European Court of Human Rights, for a final decision. The court, besides granting a remedy in the pending case, may find statutory and other national laws contrary to the provisions of the convention, and the state concerned is under an obligation to adapt its legal rules to the principles stated by the court. Great Britain too has accepted this special jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights; this means that in its political system possible legislative encroachments on individual rights can now be rebuked by a judicial I agency, though not a national one. In countries having an internal

160





system of judicial review the European protection is added to that provided by the national system.<br><br>

The decisions of the European Court of Human Rights are important because they may gradually work as a factor that will unify this branch of the law throughout Europe. Some national Constitutional courts, notably the Austrian court, already pay particular attention to the jurisprudence of the European court. So does the court of the European Community, which while not having to apply a community bill of rights (the Treaty of Rome contains none) must nevertheless take into account the problems of fundamental rights in developing the economic law issuing from the legislative organs of the EC.<br><br>

A convention on human rights similar to the European one was signed by several Latin-American states at San José, Costa Rica, in 1969. A court having jurisdiction over individual complaints began functioning in 1982.<br><br>

Thus the idea of the rights of the individual, after having contributed three centuries ago to the birth of the modern Constitutional law of the national state, has now become the mainspring of another incipient, promising experience: judicial review with transnational dimensions.<br><br>

4.6 The Ombudsman<br><br>

The ombudsman is a part of the system of administrative law for scrutinizing the work of the executive. He is the appointee not of the executive but of the legislature. The ombudsman enjoys a large measure of independence and personal responsibility and is primarily a guardian of correct behaviour. His function is to safeguard the interests of citizens by ensuring administration according to law, discovering instances of maladministration, and eliminating defects in administration. Methods of enforcement include bringing pressure to bear on the responsible authority, publicizing a refusal to rectify injustice or a defective

161



administrative practice, bringing the matter to the attention of the legislature, and instigating a criminal prosecution or disciplinary action. Sweden created the office of ombudsman in the Constitution of

1809, the holder of that office was occupied with civil affairs and was When appointed by the legislature. He was independent of both executive and judiciary and had full powers to inquire into the details of any administrative or executive act and into certain judicial activities if reported to him by individuals as an abuse of rights. He had effective authority to prosecute civil servants and other public officials-including. on occasion, ministers themselves.<br><br>

The Swedish ombudsman's responsibility now comprises civil affairs, including the judicature, the police, prisons, and the public administration, both central and local, but excluding ministers and the monarch. He can act as a public prosecutor (although he does not often do so); as a receiver of complaints from aggrieved citizens; or as an inspector of such institutions as jails, mental hospitals, homes for delinquent children, and retreats for alcoholics to discover if they are being administered in accordance with the law.<br><br>

The institution of ombudsman was first adopted in other Scandinavian countries and then-especially from the 1960s-in many countries throughout the world, including New Zealand (1962), the United Kingdom (1967), Israel (1971), Portugal (1976), The Netherlands (1981), and Spain (1981). Australia, the United States, and Canada have ombudsmen at the state or provincial level, and in the United States several cities have municipal ombudsmen. In Britain there is an ombudsman to investigate complaints against local government, the National Health Service, and administration in Northern Ireland, in addition to the ombudsman operating at the national level. Some specialized ombudsmen have been appointed in the United States to safeguard the rights of prisoners to medical treatment. In Israel the police have an office of public complaints,

162




and there is a military ombudsman; there is also a state controller, who asues annual reports on executive procedures.<br><br>

There is no doubt about the value of the ombudsman in the states in which the institution has been established. Part of the ombudsman's usefulness lies in his ability to reassure citizens who believe they have been unjustly treated that careful inquiry into their complaints shows their suspicions to be groundless. In most countries the ombudsman has little positive power other than the right to inspect and to demand the fallest information. He may, however, recommend a particular interpretation of, or a particular modification of, the law. He can also recommend that the government pay compensation to a complainant.<br><br>

4.7 Administrative Procedure<br><br>

An orderly procedure, besides being efficient, allows responsibility to be fixed on a particular officer or body at each stage of the administrative process. It can safeguard the rights of citizens and protect the executive against the criticism of having acted in an arbitrary manner. It can ensure regularity and consistency in the handling of individual cases. Much depends, however, on the quality and purpose of the procedural requirements. Most countries possess only an uncodified mass of administrative law prescribing procedure. Much of it is to be found in the laws and regulations governing particular functions of government, such as taxation, public health, education, and town planning.<br><br>

Rules of administrative procedure cover such matters as the setting of administrative machinery in motion; methods for lodging appeals; the rights of interested persons; the time limits that must be observed; the conditions to be satisfied by objectors; and the right of legal representation. The leading treatise on U.S. administrative law devotes many chapters to such procedural topics as rule making, requirement of

163










opportunity to cross-examine and rebut adjudication procedure, examiners, bias, evidence, official notice, findings, reasons, and opinions. <br><br>

Some countries have a general code of administrative procedure embodied in legislation. Among them are Austria, Poland, Spain, and the United States.<br><br>

In common-law systems, the doctrine of natural justice influences administrative procedure in two ways: (1) that a person may not be judge of his own cause, and (2) that a person shall not be dealt with to his material disadvantage, whether of person or property, or removed from or disqualified for office, without being given adequate notice of what is alleged against him and an opportunity to defend himself.<br><br>

An indirect result of the second principle is the public hearing, widely used by government departments (and in the United States by regulatory commissions) in deciding matters involving individual or corporate rights. In the United Kingdom a public inquiry is now a common means of handling appeals to the Department of the Environment against the decisions of local authorities in such matters as planning applications and compulsory purchase of land.<br><br>

In 1957 the Franks Committee was appointed by the British Lord Chancellor to study administrative tribunals and such procedures as the holding of a public inquiry. The committee declared that the work of administrative tribunals and of public inquiries should be characterized by openness, fairness, and impartiality, and their report applied these aims in great detail. The recommendations of the committee were largely accepted and resulted in the Tribunals and Enquiries Act of 1958.<br><br>

164




4.8 The Experience of India<br><br>

In the context of India, the study of judicial review can be made in three different periods: the period of pre- Government of India Act, the period of the Government Act and the period of post independence.<br><br>

4.8.1 The Period One: The Government of India Act 1858 laid down some provision regarding the power of judicial review. The law court had power to examine the Constitutionality of legislative acts on the ground of legislative incompetence or usurpation of legislative powers. 258 <br><br>

In this tenure, the Indian courts had power to determine Constitutionality of legislative acts. The Calcutta High court in Empress v. Burah and Book Singhas held that a particular legislative enactment of the Governor. General in Council was in excess of the authority given to him by the Imperial Parliament and therefore invalid. Hearing an appeal of this case the Privy Council later held that the High Court of Calcutta was not empowered to consider whether the legislation of the Governor General was Constitutional or not.<br><br>

4.8.2 The Period-Two: On December 6, 1937, for the first time in the history of India the Federal Court was inaugurated under the Government of India Act, 1935. In this Act, the Federal Court was not explicitly empowered the power of judicial review, but it was impliedly empowered to pronounce judicially upon the validity of the statutes 260. <br><br>

The federal court was introduced by the Government of India Act, 1935 to function as an arbiter in the central and state relationship and to scrutinize the violation of the Constitutional directives regarding the distribution of powers on the introduction of federalism in India, During

261. Jha, op. cit, at 131.

165




this period as Constitutional interpreter the federal court and the High Courts of India reviewed the Constitutionality of a large number of legislative Acts with full judicial self-restraint, insight and ability. Though there was no specific provision for JR in the Government of India Act 1935, the federal court is seemed success to have been adopting the power of judicial review against legislation. The case of Bhola Prasad is its unique examples.262. <br><br>

4.5.3 The Period Three: Under the present Constitution of India, the scope of judicial review is somewhat circumscribed as compared to that in the U.S.A. in India Art 131 A (1) and Act 226 of the Constitution give the exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court and the High Court to determine all questions relating the Constitutional validity of any central law and state law respectively263<br><br>

The provisions of the fundamental rights contained in part III of the Indian Constitution furnish the real basis for the power of judicial review. The fundamental subjects of judicial review in the present Constitution of

India relate to: <br><br>

• Enactment of legislative Act in violation of the Constitutional mandates regarding distribution of powers.<br><br>

⚫ Delegation of essential legislative power by the legislature to the

executive or any other body;<br><br>

• Violation of fundamental rights;<br><br>

• Violation of various other Constitutional

restrictions embodied in the Constitution;<br><br>

• Violation of implied limitations and restrictions, etc.<br><br>

In India in the post promulgation of the new Constitution 1950, there have been four stages in the progress of judicial review. The first stage was the

263. See THE CONSTITUTION OF INDIA, Arts. 131 A(1) and 226 (1950)

166




period of vagueness. The second stage was of promise. The third stage was the period of setback and the fourth stage is the period of practical review.264.<br><br>

In the tenure of first stage the court in India was seemed so vague and uncertain of its precise role in the development of new society. A.K. Gopalan's case was an evident of this. The Indian Supreme Court, for the first time asserted the doctrine of judicial review against the legislation in Gopalan 265, where the validity of the Preventing Detention Act, 1950 was challenged. In this case the main issue was whether Art 21 envisaged any procedure lay down by a law enacted by a legislative or whether the procedure should be fair and reasonable. The court held by majority that the word law in Act 21 could not be read as meaning rules of natural justice. The expression "procedural established by law would therefore mean the procedure as laid down in an enacted law. This decision offered much criticism at that time. Similarly, the court in Shankeri Prasad 20, when the Constitution (first Amendment) Act 1951, curtailing the right to property was challenged, held that fundamental rights were not excluded from the process of Constitutional amendment under Art 368, they can be amended by the parliament since they were not inviolable and beyond the reach of the process of Constitutional amendment. The matter was again raised in 1965 in Sajjan Singh, where the validity of the Constitution (17th Amendment Act, 1964) affecting the property right was challenged. The court again held the same argument as established in Shankari267.<br><br>

These vagueness and darkness dispelled soon. Chief justice Sastri in 1952 in the case of state of Madras v. V.H. Row held that the court naturally attaches great weight to the legislative judgment; it cannot desert its own

duty to determine finally the Constitutionality of an impugned statute258 The court in Golaknath209 decided the way of amendment of the Constitution could be questioned as being contrary to Art. 13(2) of the Constitution. They took the view that an amendment of the Constitution made under Act. 368 was law within the meaning of Art 13 and could not therefore, take away or abridge the fundamental rights guaranteed in part of the Constitution. The crux of the majority decision was:<br><br>

. The fundamental rights have a transcendental position under the Constitution of India and are beyond the reach of the parliament,<br><br>

. The question as to the validity of the Constitutional<br><br>

amendment is not a political question and is subject to JR. The Constitutional amendment has the force of law under Art 13(2) of the Constitution and as such it comes under the area of judicial review, and if the amendment interferes with the

fundamental right it is void.<br><br>

The power of amendment of the Constitution is derived by the parliament from Arts 245, 246 and 248 of the Constitution and not from Act 368, which deals with procedure. Thus the amendment is not a Constitutional process, but it is a legislative process.<br><br>

The Constitution (first Amendment) Act. 1951, the Constitution (fourth amendment Act.), 1955 and (seventeenth amendment) Act, 1964, are invalid but having been acquiesced for a long time by the previous Constitutional decisions are deemed to be valid and are not liable to be declared invalid.<br><br>

The judiciary
in free India thus showed a great promise in its Constitutional career in preserving the liberty and freedom of the people. <br><br>

The practical review of the doctrine of judicial review in India begins with the decision of Kesavanandada Bharati case. In 1971 parliament enacted the Constitution (24th amendment) Act introducing certain modifications in Arts 13 and 386 to get over Golaknath ruling. This amendment was designed to make an express grant of power to amend any part of the Constitution including fundamental rights. A differentiation was now made between an "ordinary law" and a "law" to amend the Constitution. In 1971, the parliament enacted the 25th amendment, which made the substitution of the word "amount" for the word "compensation" and diluted the right to property.<br><br>

The validity of those both Amendments was challenged in Kesavananda. In this case. Firstly, the majority overruled Golaknath that the power to amend the Constitution was not to be found in Art 368. Secondly, it held that parliament, in the exercise of its amending power, cannot alter the basic structure of frame work" of the Constitution. In other words Art 368 cannot be pressed into service to destroy the basic structure of the Constitution270. The next case in which the Supreme Court applied the Bharati principle as regard the non-amenability of the basic structure feature was Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narayan271, In this case, the court held that a Constitutional amendment is a law or a higher status and so it cannot damage the basic feature of the Constitution.<br><br>

The Government did not relish the Supreme Court pronouncement in Indira case, declaring clause 4, of the 39th amendment invalid and it very

much desired to ensure that never in the future the court should have the to pronounce a Constitutional amendment invalid. Accordingly Art 368 was again amended by the 42nd amendment in 1976. This amendment seeks to ensure that a Constitutional amendment may not be hallenged before any court on any ground what so ever. To achieve this abjective, two new clauses were added to Art 386. But the court again in Minerva Mills reinterpreted the doctrine that under Art 368, parliament cannot so amend the Constitution as to damage the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroy its basic structure272 <br><br>

CHAPTER FIVE<br><br>

THE SYSTEM OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN NEPAL<br><br>

5.1 Prehistory and Early History of Nepal<br><br>

A coherent dynastic history for Nepal Valley becomes possible, though with large gaps, with the rise of the lichhchhavi dynasty in the 4th or 5th century AD. Although the earlier Kirati dynasty had claimed the status of the Kshatriya caste of rulers and warriors, the lichhchhavi were probably the first ruling family in that area of Plains Indian origin. This set a precedent for what became the normal pattern thereafter-Hindu Kings claiming high-caste Indian origin ruling over a population much of which was neither Indo-Aryan nor Hindu,273<br><br>

The lichhchhavi dynastic chronicles, supplemented by numerous stone inscriptions, are particularly full from AD 500 to 700; a powerful, unified Kingdom also emerged in Tibet during this period, and the Himalayan passes to the north of the valley were opened. Extensive cultural, trade, and political relations developed across the Himalayas, transforming the valley from a relatively remote backwater into the major intellectual and commercial centre between South and Central Asia. Nepal's contacts with China began in the mid-7th century with the exchange of several missions. But intermittent warfare between Tibet and China terminated this relationship; and, while there were briefly renewed contacts in

subsequent centuries, these were reestablished on a continuing basis only in the late 18th century,274<br><br>

The middle period in Nepalese history is usually considered coterminous with the rule of the Malla dynasty (10th-18th centuries) in Nepal Valley and surrounding areas. Although most of the lichhchhavi Kings were devout Hindus, they did not impose Brahmanic social codes or values on their non-Hindu subjects; the Mallas perceived their responsibilities differently, however, and the great Malla ruler Jaya Sthiti (reigned c. 1382-95) introduced the first legal and social code strongly influenced by contemporary Hindu principles.275<br><br>

5.1.1 Middle Period<br><br>

Jaya Sthiti's successor, Yak-a Malla (reigned c. 1429-c. 1482), divided his Kingdom among his three sons, thus creating the independent principalities of Kathmandu, Patan, and Bhaktapur in the valley. Each of these states controlled territory in the surrounding hill areas, with particular importance attached to the trade routes northward to Tibet and southward to India that were vital to the valley's economy. There were also numerous small principalities in the western and eastern hill areas, whose independence was sustained through a delicate balance of power based upon traditional interrelationships and, in some cases, common ancestral origins (or claims thereto) among the ruling families. By the 16th century virtually all these principalities were ruled by dynasties claiming high caste Indian origin whose members had fled to the hills in the wake of Muslim invasions of northern India.276<br><br>

In the early 18th century one of the principalities-Gorkha ruled by the Shah family-began to assert a predominant role in the hills and even to

challenge to Nepal Valley. The Mallas, weakened by familial dissension and widespread social and economic discontent, were no pose a match for the great Gorkha ruler Prithvi Narayan Shah. He conquered the valley in 1769 and moved his capital to Kathmandu shortly thereafter, providing the foundation for the modern state of Nepal 277<br><br>

5.1.2 Modern period<br><br>

The Shah rulers faced tremendous and persistent problems in trying to centralize an area long characterized by extreme diversity and ethnic and regional parochialism. They established a centralized political system by absorbing dominant regional and local elites into the central administration at Kathmandu. This action neutralized potentially disintegrative political forces and involved them in national politics, but it also severely limited the centre's authority in outlying areas because local administration was based upon a compromise division of responsibilities between the local elites and the central administration,278<br><br>

From 1775 to 1951, Nepalese politics was characterized by confrontations between the royal family and several noble families. The position of the Shah dynasty was weakened by the fact that the two Kings who ruled successively between 1777 and 1832 were minors when they ascended the throne. The regents and the nobility competed for political power, using the young rulers as puppets; both factions wanted a monopoly of political offices and power for their families, with their rivals exterminated, exiled to India, or placed in a subordinate status. This was achieved by the Thapa family (1806-37) and, even more extensively, by the Rana family (1846-1951). In these periods, the Shah ruler was relegated to an honorary position without power, while effective authority was concentrated in the hands of the leading members of the dominant family. Although intra-familial arrangements on such questions as the succession

and the distribution of responsibilities and spoils were achieved. no effective national political institutions were created. The excluded noble families had only two alternatives-to accept inferior posts in the administration and army or to conspire for the overthrow of the dominant family. Until 1950 and to some extent thereafter, Nepalese politics was basically conspiratorial in character, with familial loyalty taking precedence over loyalty to the crown or nation, 279<br><br>

5.1.3 External Relations, 1750-1950<br><br>

Prithvi Narayan Shah (reigned 1742-75) and his successors established a unified state in the central Himalayas and launched an ambitious and remarkably vigorous program of expansion, seeking to bring the entire hill area, from Bhutan to Kashmir, under their authority. They made considerable progress, but successive setbacks in wars with China and Tibet (1788-92), with the Sikh Kingdom in the Punjab (1809), with British India (1814-16), and again with Tibet (1854-56) frustrated Nepal and set the present boundaries of the Kingdom.280<br><br>

The British conquest of India in the 19th century posed a serious threat to Nepal-which expected to be another victim-and left the country with no real alternative but to seek an accommodation with the British to preserve its independence. This was accomplished by the Rana family regime after 1860 on terms that were mutually acceptable, if occasionally irritating, to both. Under this de facto alliance, Kathmandu permitted the recruitment of Nepalese for the highly valued Gurkha units in the British Indian Army and also accepted British "guidance" on foreign policy; in exchange, the British guaranteed the Rana regime against both foreign and domestic enemies and allowed it virtual autonomy in domestic affairs. Nepal, however, was also careful to maintain a friendly relationship with China<br><br>

and Tibet, both for economic reasons and to counterbalance British predominance in South Asia, 281<br><br>

withdrawal from India in 1947 deprived the Ranas of a vital The British external source of support and exposed the regime to new dangers. Anti Rana forces, composed mainly of Nepalese residents in India who had served their political apprenticeship in the Indian nationalist movement, formed an alliance with the Nepalese royal family, led by King Tribhuvan (reigned 1911-55), and launched a revolution in November 1950. With strong diplomatic support from New Delhi, the rebels accepted a settlement with the Ranas under which the sovereignty of the crown was restored and the revolutionary forces, led by the Nepali Congress Party, gained an ascendant position in the administration, 282<br><br>

5.1.4 Nepal since 1950<br><br>

The introduction of a democratic political system in Nepal, a country accustomed to autocracy and with no deep democratic tradition or experience, proved a formidable task. A Constitution was finally approved in 1959, under which general elections for a national assembly were held. The Nepali Congress won an overwhelming victory and was entrusted with the formation of Nepal's first popular government. But persistent controversy between the Cabinet and King Mahendra (reigned 1955-72) led the King to dismiss the Nepali Congress government in December 1960 and to imprison most of the parties's leaders. The Constitution of 1959 was abolished in 1962, and a new Constitution was promulgated that established the crown as the real source of authority. King Mahendra obtained both Indian and Chinese acceptance of his regime, and the internal opposition was weak, disorganized, and discouraged. Mahendra died in January 1972 and was succeeded by his son Birendra, who was crowned in 1975.<br><br>

175pp



Throughout the 1970s King Birendra sought to expedite economic development programs while maintaining the "non-party" political system established by his father. The results were disappointing on both accounts, and by 1979 a systemic crisis was evident. To meet the first serious political challenge to the monarchy since 1960, King Birendra announced in May 1979 that a national referendum would be held to decide between a non-party and multi-party (by implication, parliamentary) political system. In the referendum, which was held in May 1980, the political groups supporting the existing non-party system won by the relatively small margin of 55 percent, accurately reflecting the sharp differences in the country on basic political issues?<br><br>

It was in this context that King Birendra decided in 1980 to retain the 1962 Constitution but to liberalize the political system by providing for direct popular election of the National Assembly. The government also permitted the "illegal" political parties, such as the Nepali Congress Party, to function under only minimal constraints. Elections were still formally held on a "party-less" basis, but many candidates ran informally and openly as members of political parties.<br><br>

This political movement toward a democratic parliamentary system satisfied neither the supporters of a multi-party Constitutional monarchy nor several more radical leftist factions, and in February 1990 a coalition of centrist and leftist opposition forces began a campaign demanding basic political reforms. A series of protests and strikes followed nationwide, and the royal government's efforts to suppress the movement with force were ineffectual. In April, as the situation in Kathmandu Valley worsened, King Birendra lifted the ban on political parties, abrogated the more repressive security ordinances, and on April 16 appointed a coalition interim government headed by the president of the Nepali Congress, K.S. Bhattarai, but also including the moderate faction of the communist movement, the United Leftist Front.<br><br>

176pp




The policy objectives of the interim government were "to maintain law and order, develop a multi-party system on the basis of Constitutional monarchy, draft a new Constitution, and hold general elections to a parliament. Within a year, all four tasks were accomplished with remarkable success despite the broad divergence of views among the major political organizations. A draft of the new Constitution, prepared by a broadly representative government commission, was submitted to the Palace and the Cabinet on September 10, 1990. In November, following two months of vigorous debate on a number of key issues-including the role of the King, the development of a secular state, emergency powers, and the status of Nepal's many languages-an amended version of the Constitution was promulgated by King Birendra that provided for both a Constitutional monarchy and a multi-party parliamentary political system.<br><br>

General elections held on May 12, 1991, gave the Nepali Congress a majority in Parliament (110 of 205 seats), but the moderate United Marxist-Leftist Party (UML), with 69 seats, emerged as a strong opposition party. The two "Pancha" parties usually associated with the old system won only four seats. The elections were thus perceived to constitute a strong endorsement of the 1990 political changes, and G.P. Koirala, the brother of Nepal's first elected prime minister (1959-60), was nominated by the Nepali Congress and appointed by the King to head the new elected government.<br><br>

Nepal emerged from this period of rapid political change facing a multitude of economic and social problems; among these were a stagnant economy and a variety of regional ethnic and religious movements, some of whose basic demands were not acceptable to the country's Hindu majority. Although overwhelming support existed for the new democratic Constitutional monarchy system, at both the party and the public level, the democratic movement itself remained badly fractionalized and antagonistic, making more difficult the new government's attempt to

introduce the kind of hard-hitting economic and social policies the Panchayat governments had carefully avoided in an effort to mollify several small but important interest groups. Leo E. Rose<br><br>

5.1.5 Government<br><br>

Although reforms in the 1950s began to move the Kingdom toward a democratic political system, the crown dissolved Parliament in 1960 and subsequently banned political parties. Thereafter, Nepal became only nominally a Constitutional monarchy, and the Constitution of 1962 (amended 1967, 1976, and 1980) effectively gave the King autocratic control over a multi tiered system of Panchayats (local bodies, or councils). In the 1980s, political restrictions were eased, and organizations such as the Nepali Congress Party, the Communist Party of Nepal, numerous small left-leaning student groups, and several radical Nepalese antimonarchist groups were allowed to operate more or less openly. Political parties, however, were not again legalized until 1990, when nationwide unrest forced King Birendra to accept the formation of a multi-party parliamentary system.283<br><br>

5.2 Evolution of Judicial Review in Nepal<br><br>

The historical analysis of the evolution of judicial system and judicial review in Nepal can be studied on two-fold basis: (1) the judicial system of traditional era, which include: a) Kirant Era b) Lichhchhavi Era and c) Medieval Era (Malla and Shah) and (2) the Judicial system under Modern Era, which include: (a) The judicial system in Rana period (b) The judicial system from 2007 to 2047 (post 2007 to 2017 and post 2017 to 2047), and (c) The judicial system post 2047.<br><br>

5.2.1 The Kirant Era: Dr. Jagadish Chandra Regmi writes the Kirantian society was controlled, regulated and governed by "Mundhum". It was the

178pp




greatest legend like Vedas to Hindus and was considered as a Constitution for Kirant According to the spirit of Mundhum it was a duty of the King to dispense justice to the people. There was Chumlung (House of Lords), some what like the judiciary of modern time. A convicted person was produced before the Chumlung for declaring punishment. The case used be prosecuted in an open assembly. The final hearing of the case was heard by the King. This system of hearing of an appeal can be characterized a as the system of (judicial) review of that time. However, the system was unwritten and was not expressly mentioned anywhere.<br><br>

5.2.2 The Lichhchhavi Era: In Lichhchhavi era Dr. Jagadish Chandra Regmi writes 285 the legal system was based on Dharmashastra, including religions, myths and realities. So far as the administration of justice was concerned the rulers in lichhchhavi era had paid sufficient attention towards the development of well-managed justice system. There were different branches of judiciary, namely, the Panchali, the Adhikaran and the Antarasan and Parmasan286. The Panchali was empowered to hear the preliminary cases and decide them. It was somewhat like our trial Courts of modern time. The Adhikaran was divided into seven different branches subject to the nature of the litigation. Of them, the Kuther Adhikaran was empowered to hear the cases relating to tax, the Shuli Adhikaran relating to cases called five named crimes, namely theft, adultery, murder, sedition and abetting habitual criminal. The Lingwal Adhikaran was given power to hear cases relating to canal water, tap etc. The Mapchouk Adhikaran was given power on cases like marriage, divorce etc. The Bhattadhikaran was assigned to look after the cases of trade and occupation. The Pashchimadhikaran was for the settlement of disputes relating to temple<br><br>

and religions and the Purbadhikaran was set up in the palace and had to look after justice dispensing247<br><br>

The Antarason and Parmasan were high level Courts formed in Royal palace. The nature of these Courts was like a review Court. This gives some sort of impression of the inclusion of the doctrine of judicial review in the lichhchhavi era.<br><br>

5.2.3 The Malla Era: In the Malla era, the Kingdom of Nepal was primarily divided into two provinces, namely, Karnali Pradesh and Gandak Pradesh. The ruling system and administration system was different in those provinces. Yet the common feature between these principalities system was the recognition of Dharmasastra as the main source of their laws.<br><br>

For the purpose of dispensing speedy and fair justice to the people, the Malla had established the Court system in accordance with the nature of cases. There were kotiling Adalat and Itachapali Adalat. The Jurisdiction of the former was confined to the civil cases and the latter to criminal cases. Despite of this, the King was final authority of executive, judicature and legislature. By this system, it can be presumed that the final authority of judicial review was empowered to the King.<br><br>

5.2.4 The Shah Era (Prior to 1910 B.S.): The judicial system in this era was very much nearest to the judicial system of continental legal system. The investigation of the criminal cases was made by a police appointed by the Court. The Court system existed in Malla era was given continuation in this era. During the Prithivi Narayan regime, the Court system was developed also extending to out side the valley. A High Court was established in the valley. It had dual jurisdiction. It was not only empowered to decide the preliminary cases within the territory of Kathmandu valley but also to review the cases decided by the Court<br><br>

established outside the valley. This system gives some realization of the r of judicial review of Courts. power<br><br>

5.2.5 The Judicial System in Rana Period: The judicial system in Rana period was somewhat like inquisitorial one. However, the independent Judicial system was not developed. All executive, legislative and judicial powers were vested in Shree Teen Maharaj. Provided the former Chief Justice Nayan Bahadur Khatri observes that the justice dispensation system in the Rana regime was very cheap and speedy.<br><br>

The Establishment of Pradhan Nyayalaya: Shree Teen Maharaj Judha Shamsher wanted to show that he was not a despotic ruler, for this he wanted to separate the function of the judiciary form the executive and legislature. With this view, in 1997 he established a Court called Pradhan Nyayalaya. It was an apex Court of the nation. It was independent of the legislative and executive branches. Government of Nepal Act, 1948289, the first written Constitution of the Kingdom continued the Pradhan Nyayalaya. Latter, clause I of Article 29 of the Interim Govt. of Nepal Act, 1951 established the Pradhan Nyayalaya as the Apex Court of the land290<br><br>

5.2.6 The Judicial System Post 2007 to 2047 B. S.<br><br>

5.2.6.1 Post 2007 to 2017<br><br>

This period was an experimental period for the development of judicial system in Nepal. In this era, the Interim Government Act, 2007 was promulgated that recognized the Pradhan Nyayalaya as an apex Court of the land,<br><br>

5.2.6.1.1 Pradhan Nyayalaya Act, 2008<br><br>

The Pradhan Nyayalaya Act was enacted in 2008. It made several provisions regarding Pradhan Nyayalaya. For the first time in the legal history of Nepal this Act under Section 30 empowered the Pradhan Nyayalaya the writ jurisdiction with the power of judicial review. By

exercising this power, the full bench of the Pradhan Nyayalaya in Bsheshwor u. Commissioner Magistrate case declared the Section 1 (sa) of Commissioner Magistrate void as being contrary to the Section 30 of the Pradhan Nyayalaya Act, 2008292<br><br>

Unfortunately in 2010, through second amendment the King Tribhuvan abrogated all power of Pradhan Nyayalaya to stay the order on writ petition and to declare the administrative and legislative actions null and void. He dismissed Section 30 of the Pradhan Nyayalaya Act that had empowered Nyayalaya the exclusive power of review.<br><br>

After the pass away of Tribhuvan, due to political pressure, the King Mahendra again restored the power of Pradhan Nyayalaya and revived the Section 30 in 2012 B.S. But, in 2013, he dismissed in total the Pradhan Nyayalaya Act and enacted the new Act called Supreme Court Act.<br><br>

5.2.6.1.2 Establishment of Supreme Court

The Supreme Court Act, 2013 established the Supreme Court as a Court of Record of the land293. The Act made a new hierarchy of Court, which included:<br><br>

2. Appellate Court, and<br><br>

3. Amini Court.<br><br>

5.2.7 Judicial Review and Constitutional Development in Nepal<br><br>

The Constitutional law of a country can only be studied in the context of the history in which the Constitution is set, and against the background of the politics in which it operates. In this respect, the development process of Nepal is not so much different to that of the process of other countries. Nepal's history of Constitutional law is as old as that of many other countries in the world, but an exhaustive elaboration here is beyond the scope of this Commentary. At the outset, it must be emphasized here that

1949 Nepal was notable for not having a formal Constitutional document. Until that time, the symbols, values and teachings of Hinduism prior to had been for more than six thousand years the thread that drew the experiences of Nepalese society into a recognizable pattern,294<br><br>

The concept of law and governance (dharma) rose with the development of monarchy in Nepal, which had always been an indigenous institution. The earliest Kings were the chieftains of victorious warring bands ruling over small principalities. It is against this background that the prominent Kings of Nepal the Licchavis (from 300-700AD), the Mallas (1100-1768), and the Shahas (1559-1950) ruled the country from the inception of Nepal as a political state to the middle of twentieth century.<br><br>

Discussion of the Hindu religion automatically implies belief in God (or. more broadly, of a belief in supernatural powers or a supernatural realm) and in religion as an ethical foundation of the state and a moral compass for life. Historically, the concept of dharma was the most important governing rule of Hindu thought.295 The word dharma refers to the privileges, duties and obligations of a man, his standard of conduct towards God, to society and to himself, and the concept of dharma was a moral standard against which all religious, political and social actions were to be tested, thereby defining relations between man and his society.<br><br>

The governing principles of dharma rested primarily and essentially upon the Hindu scriptures like Vedas, or revelations (srutis). Whereas srutis, the revealed Vedic hymns (followed by sutras (codes), smritis (memories), nibandhas (commentaries on smritis), and other literature) constituted the foundation of the written texts of the laws of the society, it might be said that achara (i.e. Approved customs or usages) furnished the unwritten<br><br>

article of the law, 296 In order to ensure good governance, curb anarchy and bring society to the path of righteousness, the Hindu scriptures also provided for raj dharma, the King's Code, and dandaniti, the rules of sanction and punishment. Just as dharma upheld the society, a King was to uphold dharma through the instrument of danda 297 The overall supremacy of dharma was so well established in the political theory that the King who was the embodiment of danda was destroyed if the acted contrary to the known laws or dharmashastras. The fundamental and the foremost element of Constitutionalism accepted by all adherents of Hindu religion, both rulers and the ruled was, therefore, the supremacy of dharma which might be termed in the popular western sense as a form of higher law. In a remarkable piece of research on the development of the concept of dharma in Nepal prior to the first decade of the sixth century, Kaisher Bahadur has concluded:<br><br>

Under this Hindu polity, the King was to be a strong ruler, administering the dharma, its different laws and traditions. He was the head of the executive and his executive function, which was mainly religious because the functions were expected to be in accordance with dharma always and rarely secular in the modern sense, required a large number of Ministers and other officials. Since dharmashastras were the supreme norms of human conduct and the King's duties were to protect the people and enforce dharma through the instrumentality of danda, his role to legislate new laws, was very narrow- especially since dharma included in its folds social practices, customs and conventions. The raj dharma, therefore, required the King to honour the customs and traditions of the society. In turn, dharmashastras ensured that the King administered justice in accordance with the Vedas, with sacred directives and with the usage and customs of the country. Any violation of dharma was a sin, liable to penalty according to the gravity of sin.<br><br>

The power of the King to impose taxes was largely based on his obligation to protect his subjects and ensure righteous government although no clear cut concept of "rights" existed. The issue much emphasized was "responsibility" and "obligation" without naming the term "right". Thus, just as the King had obligations to his subjects they in turn have obligations to him, and society was organized through a division of labor - the so-called Varna system (which later had many distortions). The growth of a patrimony-based social system, the lack of any universality of laws due to local contribution, unequally classified social groups, and the diffused nature of religion and law, were all factors which contributed to the evolution of the unique socio-political system of Hindu society. 5.2.7.1 Government of Nepal Act 1948<br><br>

Government of Nepal Act, declared in 1948 by the then Rana Prime Minister, was a first written Constitution of Nepal. It consisted of 6 Chapters, 68 Articles and 1 annex. It had, for the first time, inserted the list of fundamental rights under Chapter- two which included:298<br><br>

⚫ Right to personal liberty;<br><br>

Right to freedom of expression;<br><br>

Right to freedom of publication;<br><br>

Right to freedom to form association or organization;<br><br>

• Right to freedom of religion;<br><br>

Right to complete equality in the eye of law;<br><br>

Right to cheap and speedy justice; Right to free compulsory elementary education;<br><br>

Right to vote; and<br><br>

Right to property.<br><br>

Though the Constitution inserted the provision of judiciary called Administration of Justice and provisioned for the institution of a Pradhan Nayalaya in Nepal under Chapter-five, it had not mentioned any provision

2 GOVERNMENT OF NEPAL ACT art. 4 (1948).

185pp



for the system of judicial review. Because of this the mere provisions of fundamental rights inserted in the Constitution had no meaning at all. Provided one of the pre-requisites of the system of judicial review-the security of the tenure of service of the judges of the apex Court-was guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 54 (b) of the Constitution read that Judges of the Pradhan Nayalaya may only be dismissed from the job if the motion of impeachment for that purpose was passed by the session of both Houses.<br><br>

The Constitution generally derives its source from people in the sense that at is the expression of the general will of the people. So far this Act is concerned it neither derived the source from people nor did it represent the general will of the people or society. This Act was framed with the delegated power given by the Prime Minister Shree Teen Padam Shamsher. Based to these reasons, some jurists in Nepal throw doubt on whether or not the Act could be treated as a Constitution. In spite of all these, this Act is regarded as the first written Constitution of Nepal.<br><br>

The provision of the judiciary was incorporated in Chapter 4 of the Act under the title "Administration of Justice. 300 Cheap and speedy justice was expected. Article 53(a) of the Act has made the provision of High Court that could be Pradhan Nayayalaya301, The Act ran as follows;<br><br>

These shall be a high Court for Nepal (Pradhan Nyayalaya). The high Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and such other Judges, no exceeding twelve in number as High Highness may from time to time deem it necessary to appoint. Provided that High Highness may, on the recommendation of the chief justice, appoint to act as additional judges of the High Court for such period not exceeding two years as may be required, and the judges so appointed shall, while so acting, have all the powers of a Judge in the Court.

Article 55 of the Act had recognized the High Court as a Court of record and had such jurisdiction, but the power and authority given to it or the administration of justice could be exercised as prescribed in the law303, The High Court was vested with the power to supervise over all Courts for the time being subject to its jurisdiction 304 The Act was, however, silent empowering the judiciary the power of judicial review. The Court was not independent; it was accountable to Ranas and could not go beyond the will of Ranas. Similarly, fundamental rights and duties of people were contained in Article II of the Act, called directive principles of the state policy without being guaranteed in the Constitution. The people could not enjoy any Constitutional remedy in case of the violation of their rights105<br><br>

Thus, the Court, in this era could not exercise the power of judicial review. 5.2.7.2 Interim Government of Nepal Act 1951<br><br>

Government of Nepal Act 1948 could not exist for a long time because of the internal conflict among the Ranas. It collapsed without being enforced. As a result, on the 10th April, 1951 King Tribhuvan promulgated an interim Constitution known as the Interim Government of Nepal Act 1951, pending the framing of a democratic Constitution by a constituent assembly elected by the people. As the proposed Constituent Assembly was not elected, the interim Constitution remained in force until 1959 when it was replaced by the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1959.<br><br>

In this Constitution, the provision of the judiciary was incorporated in Part Ill of the Constitution. And the Pradhan Nyayalaya was accepted as the Apex Court of Nepal under the clause (i) of Article 29 of the Constitution. The Constitution was, however silent on the power of judicial review to the judiciary. Similarly the fundamental rights were incorporated under the provisions of the directives principles and policies of the state in Article II. They were merely directives to the Government in the Governance of the

state, but not guaranteed in the Constitution. The violation of such rights could not be questioned in the Court of Law.<br><br>

This Constitution- the second written Constitution of Nepal, comprised 7 Parts, 47 Articles (at the time of first promulgation) and after amendment 73 Articles and 1 annex, amended for six times, the Interim Government of Nepal Act was declared in 1951 by the then King Tribhuvan. It had inserted the list of basic citizen's rights (i.e. fundamental rights) under Article 16 which was contained under the Directive Principles of the State Policy. Citizens' rights inserted under the Directive Principles of the State Policy were as follows:306<br><br>

. Freedom of speech and expression;<br><br>

.Freedom of peaceful assemble;<br><br>

⚫ Freedom to form association or organization;<br><br>

. Freedom of free movement within the territory of the Kingdom;<br><br>

• Freedom to reside and settle down at any part of the Kingdom;<br><br>

Freedom to acquire, enjoy and sell the property;<br><br>

Freedom to practice any trade, business, occupation or profession:<br><br>

Besides, rights regarding criminal justice such as right against the use of ex-post facto laws, right against double jeopardy and right against self incrimination were also enshrined in Article 17 of the Act.307 Article 18 read that: no person shall be deprived of his right to life or liberty save in accordance with the procedure established by Act or rule enacted by HMG for the purpose of maintaining public interest, peace or security 30s The night of a child below 14 years was also guaranteed against risky and dangerous employment such as in mines or industry where chemical substance is used.309 Despite the constitutional measures, since all the

rights enshrined there were under directive principles of the state policy; they were not enforceable by the Court of law in case they were denied to enjoy by the people or violated or encroached by the government.<br><br>

A provision of judiciary (administration of justice) was ensured by the Constitution. It had a provision of Pradhan Nayalaya as the apex Court, but it never granted the power of judicial review to it.310<br><br>

After the amendment, some new provisions were inserted in the Constitution in regard to rights of the citizen and institution of judiciary. Rights of the citizen enunciated thereon were as follows:<br><br>

Equality before law and equal protection of law;311<br><br>

. Right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them;312<br><br>

Equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters in relating to employment or appointment to any office under His Majesty's Government;313<br><br>

. Right against levying or collecting tax except under the authority of

Rights to freedom of speech and expression; to assemble peaceably

Right against traffic in human beings and beggars and other similar forms of forced labour;318<br><br>

.Right of the children below the age of fourteen years not to be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other

hazardous employment.319<br><br>

Although the provision of judiciary (administration of justice) was kept up in by the Constitution even after its several amendments, it never granted the power of judicial review to the apex Court.320<br><br>

In spite of all this, the Pradhan Nyayalaya had displayed judicial creativity of a high order in this period. Bed Krishna V. Secretary Udyog Banijya is a unique example of this, where the Court held that the doctrine of the role of law was an essential part of the Constitution and the doctrine could be enforced only though the power of Judicial Review. Likewise in Bishenshwor Prasad the full bench of Pradhan Nyayalaya declared the Section 1(xxx) of commissioner magistrate void as being contrary to the Section 30 of the Pradhan Nyayalaya Act, 2008.<br><br>

Thus, the Pradhan Nyayalay seems to have asserted the power of judicial review of legislation in the tenure of this Constitution for the first time in the legal history of Nepal. 5.2.7.3 The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1959<br><br>

This Constitution was framed in 1959 on the supervision and guidance of Sir Ivor Jennigs, a renowned Constitutional Jurist of the United Kingdom. This Constitution is seemed more democratic and liberal to that of the previous Constitutions, namely, the Government of Nepal Act 1948 and the Interim Constitution 1951.<br><br>

This Constitution has introduced representative Government in Nepal for the first time. The general elections were held on the 18% of February. 1959 to elect the first parliament. Besides, the Constitution was regarded as the fundamental law of the state and all laws in consistent with it would to the extent of such inconsistency be void under Article 1(1) of the Constitution 322<br><br>

Promulgated by the then King Mahendra with the exercise of royal (state) power and privileges inherent in the King, and with a desire to guaranteeing fundamental rights to the people (as was claimed and expressed by the King through preamble), this was the first Constitution to guarantee fundamental rights and ensure power of judicial review to the judiciary 223 In addition to, Article! of the Constitution also ensured that Constitution was a fundamental law of Nepal and all laws inconsistent with it, to the extent of such inconsistency, would be void.<br><br>

The Constitution guaranteed fundamental rights to the people under Art. 3. Crucial rights, among others, were as follows:<br><br>

• Right to life and personal liberty;324<br><br>

See THE CONSTUTITION OF THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL, art 1(1) (1959) 1 See Id. at preamble. See Id art 31).<br><br>

and be defended by a legal practitioner (in case he/she is detained in custody);327

human

. Right to be produced before a judicial authority within a period

twenty-four hours after arrest;328

of

Right against preventive detention;329 Right to equal protection of law and right against discrimination

on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them in the application of general law;330

Right to religion;33: Right to property;332

Right to political freedoms, namely, expression and publication; assemble without arms; form unions and associations; and move throughout the Kingdom and reside in any Article thereof;

Similarly, the Constitution, for the first time in the history of Nepalese Constitutional laws, guaranteed the right to remedy as a fundamental right of the people,334 To this provision, the Court had power to issue necessary and appropriate orders and writs including the writs of habeas

corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo-warranto for the enforcement of right conferred by the Constitution.

Another significant provision outlined by the Constitution was Article54 which ensured that any person who claimed the whole or some Article of any Act or law being inconsistent with the Constitution, shall have right to move to the Supreme Court to make such laws declared void. This provision was maintained under the chapter- legislative powers, 335 Thus, in this Constitution the power of judicial review is seemed to have vested in the Supreme Court though it was not explicitly mentioned in any provision. Provided the Constitution gave very wide emergency powers to the King including the power to suspend Articles III, IV and V of the Constitution, which dealt respectively with fundamental rights, executive Government and parliament and to assume to himself all the powers vested in the parliament or any other organ of the Government. With this emergency power, most of the provisions of Articles III, IV and V were actually suspended and this Constitution were eventually abrogated in 1962 by a Royal proclamation.<br><br>

In the tenure of this Constitution a writ petition regarding the Judicial Review of legislation was filed in the Supreme Court on the ground that the Section 10 of Civil Service Act, 2013 and the Section 19 and 20 of Citizen Right Act, 2012 were inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution. But the Court discharged the petition without any reasonable grounds336.<br><br>

The Constitution had a separate provision for judiciary under Article 4. However, the Constitution had spoken that justices including the chief justice of the Supreme Court were appointed by His Majesty the King at his own discretion.337<br><br>

5.2.7.4 The Constitution of Nepal 1962<br><br>

In 1960, late King Mahendra suspended the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1959 dissolving the Parliament and promulgated a new Constitution, a Constitution based on non-Party system, the Constitution of Nepal, 1962. It was claimed that the Constitution, by virtue of state powers and privileges inherent in the King, was promulgated by the King 338<br><br>

This Constitution was the fundamental law of the land and all laws inconsistent with it would be void339. But no any clause or Article of the Constitution stated that the power of judicial review was vested in the Supreme Court. In fact the Court had very limited power. All executive, legislative and judicial power including the residuary one was granted to the King. However, some fundamental rights and duties were incorporated in the Constitution. Among others, the fundamental rights included in the Constitution were:<br><br>

Right to equal protection of law and right against discrimination on grounds of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them in the application of general law;340<br><br>

Right to life and personal liberty:341<br><br>

• Right to freedoms to expression and publication; to assemble peaceably and without arms; to form unions and associations; to move throughout the Kingdom and reside in any Article thereof; and to acquire, own, sell and otherwise dispose of property,342<br><br>

Right to religion;345<br><br>

Right to property;346<br><br>

.Right to Constitutional remedy;347<br><br>

Despite of guaranteeing some fundamental rights to the people, the Constitution had a blunder that was Article 17 which provisioned that the law could, for the purpose of public interest, be enacted in order to restrict or maintain the exercise of the rights conferred by the Constitution under chapter three. It was anti-thesis of Constitutional jurisprudence to make general law to be prevailed over the Constitution. This provision was also contrary to Article 1 of the Constitution. To this provision, fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution could be restricted, curtailed or suspended at any time by the enactment of ordinary laws.<br><br>

The Constitution had provision for the judiciary which had maintained under Article II. However, the Court was not independent of the executive. Justices including the chief justice of the Supreme Court were appointed by His Majesty if he thought it necessary.348<br><br>

The Supreme Court had extra-ordinary power to issue necessary and appropriate orders and writs including the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, certiorari, prohibition and quo-warranto for the enforcement of right conferred by the Constitution.349<br><br>

In spite of all this, the Supreme Court had displayed the power of judicial review in this era. The Court declared the provisory note of Section 21(2) of the Manual of District Panchyat, void in Mul Chandra Azad case350, Similarly, giving the dissenting opinion against the majority decision<br><br>

Bishwonath Upadhyay declared the Section 20 of the Land Reform Act (first amendment), 2022 void, because of the inconsistency with Article justice 11(2) of the Constitution351. The full Bench of the Supreme Court had also stated many principles in favour of the Constitution in Sarvagya Ratna Tuladhar case. In this case the Court clearly claimed that it had the power of judicial review and it could declare any law or any part there of void on the ground of inconsistency with the Constitution352. In the tenure of this Constitution, another interesting issue was raised in the Supreme Court but the Court discharged the petition without stating any reasonable grounds. Jurists commented that this incident was the hostile to the development of legal history,353<br><br>

The Court in this era also had effective exercise of the power of judicial review of legislation, in particular, the cases of Purna Chaitanya Jagandas Shankar Prasad356 and etc.<br><br>

5.2.7.5 The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990<br><br>

The Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990, was the marked contrast to all the preceding Constitutions of Nepal. It was, as compared to other Constitutions, considered both as a democratic and liberal Constitution. It had assessed some basic structures in the preamble as the core values of Constitution. They included- parliamentary democracy, adult franchise, Constitutional monarchy, independent judiciary and multi- Party system. It also assessed the King bound to cabinet; the cabinet to parliament; the parliament to people; and the people all in all -sovereign, 157<br><br>

It outlined the framework and organization of the political and social order that suits Nepal. It articulated the structure of government, procedures for selection and replacement of government officials, and distribution and limitations of their powers. It holds some unique features which include as follows: 358<br><br>

It was the first Constitution in Nepal's history to have drafted by the leaders of a mass movement, with popular consent and with

the acquiescence of the monarch.<br><br>

. It was the first document to turn the rule of law into a reality in Nepal so that no body not even the King is above the Constitution. It was the first Constitution in Nepal's history to declare that the

sovereignty of the Kingdom lies in the people.<br><br>

. It was also the first document to entrench fundamental rights to the people and to give the supreme Court exclusive jurisdiction to determine all questions relating to the Constitutional validity of executive action and laws in force in the territory of Nepal, and to issue order for the settlement of any Constitutional or legal question involved in any dispute of Public interest or concern.<br><br>

Right to press and publication, right regarding criminal justice, right against preventive detention, right to culture and education, right to information and right to privacy were incorporated in the Constitution for the first time in the Constitutional history of Nepal. What was the most striking was that the twin fundamental rights, namely, right to information and right to privacy were a unique and unparalleled feature of the Nepalese catalogue of fundamental rights, as these rights were not specifically available even to the citizens of the democratic nations such as the USA, India, Germany, France etc. In addition to these rights, the Constitution also guaranteed- right to equality and equal protection of the law; right against discrimination in the application of general laws on grounds of religion, race, sex, caste, tribe or ideological conviction or any Dhungel et.al., op. cit., at 43.<br><br>

of these; right against capital punishment; freedom to form unions and associations; right against closing or seizing any press for printing any news, Articles or reading materials; right against cancellation of the registration of any newspapers or periodicals for publishing any news, Articles or reading materials; right against the application of ex-post facto laws; right against double jeopardy; right against self-incrimination; right against physical or mental torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; right to be informed of the grounds for arrest; right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner (in case he/she is detained in custody); right to be produced before a judicial authority within a period of twenty-four hours after arrest; right regarding culture and education; right to religion; right against exploitation; and right against exile as fundamental rights of the people which were not suspended even at the time of emergency, 359<br><br>

of the rights guaranteed by the Constitution, following rights were categorized as derrogable rights pursuant to clause (8) of Article 115 of the Constitution for as long as the proclamation of emergency is in operation:

freedom of opinion and expression: freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms;

freedom to move throughout the Kingdom and reside in any part

right to Constitutional remedy (except for the remedy of habeas corpus)

right to property; and

In a unique provision, the Constitution provided for the existence of a Constitutional Council for making recommendations to the King on the appointment of officials to Constitutional Bodies. The Council consists of the Prime Minister as chairperson, the chief justice, the speaker of the House of Representatives, the chairman of the National Assembly, and the leader of the opposition in the House of Representatives as members.<br><br>

With the rise of Constitution a new phase of growth in nation' judiciary has been heralded. With this introduction, the judiciary in Nepal is structured as a three-tier hierarchy. The district Courts are the Courts of first instance and are located in all 75 districts of the Kingdom. 360 They have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters. At the second level. there are 16 appellate Courts established in various regions of the country 3 361 The Supreme Court is the Apex Court in the judicial hierarchy. All other Courts of Nepal and other institutions exercising judicial powers, except the military Court, is under to this Court 362. It is a Court of Record and can initiate proceedings and impose punishment in accordance with law for contempt of itself and of its subordinate Courts of judicial institution363. It has a power of original and appellate jurisdiction. It can

District Court is the Court of first instance. It is a trial Court and has an enormous burden of works. It has power to decide all matter such of question of fact and question of law. There are 75 District Court for every district of the country, and 120 judges are employed over there.<br><br>

Appellate Court is the second tier in the organization of Courts. It has appellate jurisdiction over the decisions of District Courts and other subordinate or quasi-judicial bodies. It has also original jurisdiction. It can issue writs such as Habeas corpus, Mandamus and injunction. It has also power to inspect supervise and give direction to its Subordinate Courts. There are 16 Appellate Courts with 107 Judges in different Articles of the country.<br><br>

See id. art. 86(1) See ld. art. 86(2).

199pp



Inspect, supervise and give direction to its subordinate Courts. It can report to His Majesty, its opinion there on any complicated legal question of interpretation of this Constitution or of any other law. The Court has exercised this power several times, for example the Das Dhunga Accident and Parliament Dissolution cases are its example. Similarly, this Court has rested with the extra ordinary power of judicial review to scrutinize the Constitutional validity of the legislation and administrative action under Article 88,365 Apart from the general Courts, there are also specialized tribunals and Courts for specific types of cases.<br><br>

The Constitution guaranteed for the judiciary such as, functional independence, the security of the tenure and so forth. The Constitution has advanced the mechanism called judicial council to make recommendations and give advice concerning the appointment of, transfer of, disciplinary action against and dismissal of judges and other matters of the district Courts and appellate Courts and the appointment of justices of the supreme Court, and the mechanism called Constitutional Council to make recommendations for the appointment of the chief justice of the supreme Court.366<br><br>

As Nepal's legal system has developed under the influence of the common law traditions of the United Kingdom, and it remains essentially a common law jurisdiction, the nation's judiciary has a central role in defending and promoting the rights of the people. Article 23 and 88 of the Constitution had given exclusive powers\responsibilities to the Supreme Court to test the Constitutional validity of any legislative and administrative action for the sake of enforcing fundamental rights contained in the part III of the Constitution.<br><br>

The spirit of the Constitution as expressed in the preamble was to establish an independent and competent system of justice as an

institution to transform the concept of the rule of law into a living reality. In fact the Constitution had presumed the judiciary not only the protector of fundamental right but also the guardian of the Constitution. The judiciary had, under Article. 88, been empowered with the exclusive power to examine the legislative Act and administrative action, and declare null and void to the extent that the Act or action was contrary to Constitution<br><br>

These extensive powers and responsibilities granted to the judiciary by the Constitution made the Court of Nepal more powerful and responsible as compared to other co-ordinate branches of Government. The Court was placed in a respective position on the cause that it could be the protector and guardian of the fundamental rights, of the Constitution and of the whole mechanisms of the state. Thus, the role of judiciary is very much responsible and serious. The state may loss grave injury or damage or face a great crisis if the judiciary becomes irresponsible or does not perform its functions duly. 5.2.7.6 The Interim Constitution of Nepal 2007<br><br>

The Interim Constitution of Nepal is the product of people's movement II. On February 1, 2005 the royal takeover was further advanced as the King appointed a government led by himself and at the same time enforced marshal law. The King argued that civil politicians were unfit to handle the Maoist insurgency,369<br><br>

A broad alliance against the royal takeover called the Seven Party Alliance (SPA) was organized, encompassing about 90% of the seats in the dissolved parliament. In December SPA signed a 12-point understanding with the Maoists. Within the framework of that understanding, the Maoists committed themselves to multi-party democracy and freedom of

speech. SPA, for their part accepted the Maoist demand for elections to a Constituent Assembly.<br><br>

At the beginning of 2006, the situation became yet tenser as SPA launched agitation programmes around the country. A series of waves of arrests of apposition leaders were conducted. The agitations reached a peak around the February 8 municipal elections, which were boycotted by the SPA and the Maoists,<br><br>

SPA called for a four-day nationwide general strike on April 5-9. The Maoists called for a cease-fire in the Kathmandu valley. The general strike saw numerous protests. A curfew was announced by the government on April 8, with reported orders to shoot protestors on sight. Despite this, small, disorganized protests continued.<br><br>

On April 9, SPA announced that it intended to continue its protests indefinitely and called for a tax boycott. The government announced plans to step up its enforcement of the curfew and claimed that the Maoists had infiltrated the protests.<br><br>

Protests continued in the following days, with crowds increasing to sizes estimated at 100,000 to 200,000 in Kathmandu in various estimates, more than 10% of the city population. On April 21, opposition sources claim that about half a million took part in the protests in Kathmandu. More conservative estimates talk about 300,000.<br><br>

Later the same evening, King Gyanendra announced that he would retur political power to the people and called for elections to be held as soon as possible. He called on SPA to nominate a new Prime Minister of Nepal in a speech on a state-owned television station, saying, "We return the executive power of the country to the people. We request the seven-Party alliance to recommend a name for the post of prime minister who will have the responsibility to run the government."<br><br>

However, the royal proclamation was rebuffed by the opposition. At 3 p.m. the next day, the leaders of SPA met in the capital, and staked out three demands, namely: reinstitution of the old parliament; formation of an all Party government; and elections to a Constituent Assembly that will draft a new constitution.<br><br>

In a nationally televised address, King Gyanendra reinstated the old Nepal House of Representatives on April 24. The King called upon the Seven Party Alliance to bear the responsibility of taking the nation on the path to national unity and prosperity, while ensuring permanent peace and safeguarding multi-party democracy. The SPA accepted the reinstitution of Parliament.<br><br>

The move was rejected by the Maoists. They stated that merely restoring the parliament was not going to resolve the problems and that the rebels planned to continue fighting against government forces. They still had demand for the formation of a Constituent Assembly and abolition of the monarchy.<br><br>

On 27 April, however, the Maoist insurgents responded to demands by Girija Prasad Koirala and announced a unilateral three-month truce in the Nepal Civil War. On May 2, Koirala announced the new government cabinet including himself and three other ministers from the Nepali Congress: K.P. Sharma Oli from CPN (UML), Gopal Man Shrestha from Nepali Congress (Democratic) and Prabhu Narayan Chaudhari from the United Left Front. This was followed on May 12 by the arrest of four ministers from the ousted royalist government and an investigation into alleged human rights violations by the army during the General Strike.<br><br>

On May 18, the Parliament unanimously passed a proclamation, what they called it an historical and significant event of the post movement. On January 15, 2007 the Interim Constitution was promulgated as a device to

arrange the interim periods and govern the country with basic legal orders.<br><br>

5.2.7.7 System of Judicial Review in the Constitution Clause (1) of Article 107 of the Interim Constitution gives exclusive jurisdiction to the Supreme Court to determine all questions relating to the Constitutional validity of any law. For the purpose of Article 107 any Nepali citizen can file a petition in the Supreme Court to have any law or any part thereof declared void on the ground of inconsistency with the Constitution370. This provision of the Constitution is a fundamental character of our Constitution. With this provision, Nepali citizens can move to the Court for the enforcement of their rights that are conferred on by the Constitution.<br><br>

Under this provision of the Constitution, the Court has generally the grounds for judicial review of legislation in two conditions:271<br><br>

. If a statute or legislative enactment violates or makes unreasonable restrictions on enjoyment of fundamental rights that are guaranteed in Article III of the Constitution, or,<br><br>

• If a statute or legislative enactment is inconsistent with any

provision of the Constitution. For the purpose of judicial review of legislation, an Act of parliament,

Article 107 is very liberal in its wording since it allows any Citizen to challenge a late although there is no actual controversy pending, and it is not necessary for a person to convince the Supreme Court that he is personally affected by such a law. The Court's power in this regard is unrestricted by any concept of Justifiability. This is an important feature of Article 107(1). The power granted by Article 107 for example, is made subject of the doctrine of justifiability in accordance with which a petitioner seeking to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court must present a real and substantial controversy which unequivocally calls for adjudication of the rights asserted. Similarly, the doctrine of ripeness is not relevant to Article 107(1) 371 Ibid.

Parliament or by other competent authority can be challenged as being inconsistent with the Constitution. In response to, any such law or rule in conflict with any provision of the Constitution can be declared by the Supreme Court as being void as a whole or as to any Article thereaf 5.2.7.7.1 The Reasonable Restriction Doctrine

According to our Constitutional provision any Nepali citizen can file a writ petition in the Supreme Court on the ground of the violation of their rights that are guaranteed in the Constitution. This provision is however, not absolute and the petitioner is not allowed to move to the Court's door in all conditions. As no right can be absolute, the legislature can impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such rights subject to the provisions of the Constitution. Such restrictions may bar the rights of the people, in that situation; the people cannot claim their rights to be revived. However, such restrictions must be fair and reasonable.<br><br>

The Indian writer M.P. Jain observes three significant rules for reasonable restriction:372 <br><br>

A restriction must be under the authority of law; this implies that the restriction under the rights can be imposed only by or under the authority of law. No restriction can be imposed by executive action alone without there being a law to back it up.<br><br>

. Each restriction much be reasonable; and

A restriction must be related to the purposes mentioned in

Constitution.

The standard of reasonableness is to be judged with due reference to the subject matter of the legislation. The directive principles of state policy are also relevant in considering whether a restriction on a fundamental right is reasonable or not. A restriction, which promotes a directive principle, is generally regarded as reasonable. It is the responsibility of the state that it has to justify that the restriction imposed on any fundamental right quarantined in the Constitution is reasonable under the same

5.3.1 The Period between 2010 to 2047 B. S.<br><br>

The trends and practices marked by the judiciary in the area of judicial review in Nepal can be a matter of long discussion. However, this study has intended to observe the judicial trends and practices in light of judicial pronouncements made by the Supreme Court of Nepal, in particular, in the time between 2010 to date.<br><br>

Bed Krishna Shrestha v. Ms Secretary, Department of Industry, Commerce, Food and Civil Supplies (2010pts is considered as the first case in the judicial history of Nepal where the Court, for the first time, asserted the power of judicial review. Interpreting the Section 30 of the Pradhan Nayalaya Act, 2008 as a source of power of the extra-ordinary jurisdiction of the Court, the Court held that power and obligation of the Pradhan Nayalaya, under Section 30, was to prevent unlawful action in case it infringed the fundamental rights of the people. The Court held that it was the judiciary to check whether or not the state action was carried out in accordance with the law. In a democratic state, judiciary was conceived as a guardian of the Constitution, and Section 30 of the Pradhan Nayalaya Act was designed on this democratic principle, held the Court.<br><br>

The Court further observed that Interim Government of Nepal Act had guaranteed fundamental rights to the people, and if any of the rights guaranteed by the Act were infringed by any body, the Pradhan Nyalaya, under Section 30 of the Act, could provide remedy to the citizen. The Court, by virtue of Section 30 of the Act, deserved power to issue appropriate orders including the writs to safeguard the fundamental rights

Issuing the writ of prohibition, the Court held that in the reign of rule of law no one is above law. All the people including His Majesty are under the law. No special law and special tribunal are referred to the employees of government. General Law is applicable even to the government employees. This landmark decision of the Apex Court clearly upheld one of the basic prerequisites of rule of law- equal subjection of all classes of people to ordinary laws and Courts.<br><br>

Interpreting the system of common law, the Court pronounced that since Article 13 of the Interim Government of Nepal Act had ensured equality before law and equal protection of law, the same law would be applicable to government, government officials and ordinary citizens. Unlike in France, Nepal did not have separate law and Court for the government officials, observed the Court.<br><br>

In Mrigendra Shamsher J. B. Rana v. Kathmandu Magistrate (2011p the Court held that it had, by virtue of Section 4 of the Personal Liberties Act, power to test the legality of action done by Magistrate under Public Security Act if the question was arisen whether the act was done in accordance with law or not. This case invoked for the writ of habeas corpus and established that the Court had power to issue such writ in case the personal liberty of an individual was in threat or under attack.<br><br>

Mrigendra Shamsher J. B. Rana v. Inspector General of Police (2011p7s was the first case in the judicial history of Nepal where the Court had issued directive order to HMG to bring an immediate amendment to Raj Kaj Ain, the Act relating to Crown.

Similarly, Pitamber Prasad Mudwari v. Riddi Bikram and others (2012pr may be taken as the first case of judicial review of administrative action in Nepal. In Bishwashwor Prasad Koirala v. Prime Minister of Nepal Government (2013p the petition was filed under Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act 2013 where the Court held that the citizens including the Prime Minister had right to freedom of opinion as ensured by Section 6(1) of the Civil Liberties Act 2012. The judgment pronounced that the PM had dual capacities i.e. the capacity of a Prime Minister and the capacity of an ordinary citizen, and as a citizen he had right to enjoy the freedom of opinion and expression like other citizen under Section 6(1) of the Act.<br><br>

It held that the Supreme Court had power to issue appropriate orders and writs including the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, quo-warranto, prohibition and certiorari for the enforcement of rights conferred by the current laws for which no other remedy had been provided.<br><br>

Interpreting the purpose of prerogative writs, the Court held that the writ of prohibition could be issued to the parties of cases or to the body which exercised judicial functions; writ of certiorari to the body or person who exercised judicial or quasi-judicial functions; writ of habeas corpus to the fillegal) detention; similarly writ of quo-warranto could be issued to hold an inquiry about the capacity of designation; and the writ of mandamus be issued if the legal duty imposed by the law to the authority had been disobeyed or ignored. The Court also held that these writs could not be issued to the Prime Minister (who exercised merely the administrative functions).<br><br>

Scope and limitation of certiorari: Functions performed by any person or body must be either judicial

or quasi-judicial in nature.

This case may be taken as the first case filed in the SC seeking remedy an the enjoyment of right to information. In this case the Court also issued a directive order to HMG to notify the laws or rules which were claimed by the petitioner as incomplete in their making process as soon as it was possible, and drew attention of the government to enact laws by abiding all the procedures required thereby. The petitioner, in this case, had challenged the status of some laws which were published in the Nepal Gazette without approval of Royal Seals.<br><br>

In Secretary Ministry of Forest v. Gajendra Bahadur Pradhananga (2015, the Court held that it had power to issue any appropriate orders or writs against His Majesty's Government by virtue of powers conferred on it by Section 30 of the Pradhan Nyayalaya Act 2008 and Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act 2013. The Court also held that the writ was issued to control arbitrary action of the executive.<br><br>

in the case, the petitioner who was suspended from his job by HMO challenged the government action in the Court. Responding to the petition the Court declared the act of suspension illegal. Though the final verdict was given by the Court in the name of respondent, the Secretary of Ministry did not intend to enforce it. The petitioner then filed the writ of mandamus seeking order to implement the Court's decision by HMG and take necessary action on the Contempt of Court. The writ was finally quashed.<br><br>

It also held that the Court. pursuant to Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act, could exercise the power of judicial review and issue certiorari for the enforcement of people rights if no other remedy had been provided thereby, 30<br><br>

Shankerman Amatya v. His Majesty's Government, Ministry of Home (2016 was another landmark case where the Supreme Court held that

it could exercise extra-ordinary jurisdiction in two conditions: If the rights of the citizens or any persons conferred by

the current laws were infringed; and If no any provision for alternative remedy for the

enforcement of such rights was provided for by other

laws.

The Court also held that no writ could be issued in case any alternative remedy was available in any other law.

In Gajendra Bahadur Pradhananga v. Attorney General Shambhu Prasad Gyanwali (2017) elaborating the scope of judicial review as was set in the previous judgments, the Court held that it could, under Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act, exercise extra-ordinary jurisdiction if the following conditions were satisfied:<br><br>

Section 11 read that- the Supreme Court shall, in case no provision for alternative remedy has been provided for the enforcement of rights conferred on to the citizens or to any persons by the current law, have power to issue appropriate orders or unts including the writs of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo-warranto and certiorari Id.

. Secondly, someone must have been restricted from the

. Thirdly, there must not be any other alternative

remedy provided for the enforcement of such rights.

This case can be taken as the first (reported) case of judicial review of agslation where the petitioner had challenged the legality of Section 10 of the Civil Service Act 2013 as being inconsistent with Sections 19 & 20 of the Civil Liberties Act 2012.

terpreting the significance of judicial review, the Court held that legality of a provision of an Act could not be challenged on the ground that it was consistent with the other provision of an Act with similar status and made from the same source.

in Maniraj Upadhyaya v. Magistrate Amritman (2017) the court for the irst time, upheld the doctrine of laches of time in the writ jurisdiction, and the writ was also quashed on the same ground.

Editor and publisher of the Samaj Patrika Maniraj Updhyaya had filed the petition in the supreme Court under Section 11 of the Supreme Court Act 2013 challenging the order of Magistrate which imposed Updhyaya to close the publication until he had submitted Rs. 1000 as a deposit on the charges that he had violated the provision contained in Section 5(d) of the Press and Publication Act 2009.

In Pushkermath Updhyaya and Others v. HMG, (2017) the court established a principle that the doctrine of judicial review could not be effective in advance or prior to have occurrence of actual event. In Uttam Shamsher and Others v. HMG, (2017),346 the petitioner had challenged the legality of rule 15(2) of the Nepal Administration Service Organization Rule on the ground that it was inconsistent with sub-rule 1 of rule 15. (Rule v. Rule) The Court held that a rule would become void if it was framed beyond the scope of empowering Act. It also held no rule had retrospective effect.<br><br>

In other issue of Uttam Shamsher and Others v. Commissioner of Public Service, (2017387 the court held that a civil servant would deserve the titles and facilities in the capacity of a government official only when his appointment was lawful. Unlawful appointment did not deserve powers and facilities to be entitled to a civil servant.<br><br>

Confirmation of the job of an employee who is under probation period rests at the discretion of HMG and Commission of Public Service. Distinguishing the question of fact from the question of law, the Court held that the doctrine of stopple was effective only on the question of fact.<br><br>

Of them, functions of the Courts are followed by the due process of law. The Courts must abide by procedures established by the law. There is no room for self-will of the Court. However, the administrative official is not under obligation to abide by the prescribed procedures to reach into a decision. Administrative functions are performed by the authority based on policy or appropriateness as determined by circumstances. Therefore, there may be more chance of discretion in the administrative functions. Similarly, there is inevitably the presence of discretionary will in the quasi-judicial functions. But there is the least degree of discretion in the judicial functions. In addition to least degree of discretion, judicial decisions must be backed by the prescribed procedures, rather than by

self-will. The Court also held that the function of Court is to provide justice and this function of the Court is generally known as judicial functions.<br><br>

It was a landmark decision of the contemporary time. It very strongly pronounced that the Court had no self-will at all. It further observed judicial functions must be backed by judicial reasoning whereas administrative functions need not necessarily be backed by reasoning and procedures. To this verdict, the writ of certiorari could not be issued if the very function was not (judicial) or quasi-judicial. It could be issued only when the function was administrative one.<br><br>

Writ jurisdiction is an alternative and special means of legal remedy. It is effective only when no other alternative remedy is available in other laws, held the Court.<br><br>

The Court in Tika Prasad Thakali v. Secretary Bhavnath Sharma and Others (2017),389 held that any person who is arrested and detained in custody should be produced before a judicial authority within a period of twenty-four hours after such arrest, excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to such authority.<br><br>

In Bharat Shamsher v.

It observed habeas corpus was not just for the enforcement of constitutional rights, it was also available for the enforcement of legal rights. In this case, the Court also pronounced writ of habeas corpus was ever a non-suspendable right of a citizen.<br><br>

Injunction has of two forms: obligatory and injunctatory (prohibitory). The former is issued to do a particular act whereas the latter is issued to refrain from doing a particular act. In this sense, some characters of mandamus and prohibition seem to have reflected in the injunction, but injunction unlike the orders of mandamus or prohibition through extra-ordinary jurisdiction is a shorter and strong alternative.<br><br>

Yagyamurti Banjade v. Durgadas Shrestha, Bagmati Special Court, Singhdarbar and Others (20272 is a landmark decision of the Court. The Court in this case held that degree of freedom in a democratic system was greater than in an autocratic regime. Compliance of both the substantive and procedural laws was compulsory to the authority while curtailing the right of personal liberty.<br><br>

The Supreme Court has power to issue any writ or order if it observes necessary even at a time where there is a demand of another type of writ Under Article 71 of the Constitution, the orders of certiorari, mandamus and habeas corpus are issued respectively against the decision of Judicial quasi-judicial authority, administrative authority and against the authority who keeps person in illegal and unauthoritative detention. In other contexts, it is the discretionary of the Court whether or not to issue the mandamus and it will not be the discretionary of the Court to issue the order of habeas corpus, but will be a duty to issue it if the appropriate grounds are established to release a detainee.<br><br>

Habeas corpus is a strong means to protect the personal liberty. No doors are closed for this writ. The Courts, unlike in other writs, can have no discretionary powers on this writ. If the petitioner justifies shows appropriate grounds to issue the order, it is issued as a right claim of a petitioner. The habeas corpus must be issued if the detainee is seemed to have been an illegal detention. It issued in all the illegal and unauthoritative detentions. Unlike in other writs, it does not distinguish between judicial and administrative.<br><br>

Preamble is an integral part of the Act. It does not limit the parent Section; it can be an assistance to understand the intention of legislators in case habeas corpus even on the basis of interpretation of few issues without the main Section is vague and ambiguous. The order can be issued in going through all other issues if from such interpretation the detention is seemed illegal.<br><br>

Boki v. Durgadas Shrestha, Bagmati Special Court, and Others 2027 differentiated the proviso and sub-clause- and observed that the Gangaram former may limit, exclude or discharge to the meaning of main Section, whereas, the latter may supplement to the main clause. In Jagannath Gyawali v. District Land Reform Authority, Kailali (2026) judicial decision held by an administrative authority was observed as quasi-judicial decision, while holding such decision, proof and evidences have to be examined by applying the laws related to facts.<br><br>

In Lal Bahadur Tamang and Others v. HMG (2027445 the Court held that if the authority had option to choice, it was up to the authority to decide what law was appropriate to the relevant facts. Omkar Prasad Shrestha v. Jailor, Central Jail and Others (2028)446 observed that in case the provisions of former and latter Acts are inconsistent with each other, it is meant that the legislator, to the extent of such inconsistency, had intention to maintain the provisions of latter Act by ending the former one.<br><br>

Different provisions of two different Acts on similar issues cannot exist together. In case of the existences of two similar provisions in two different laws, the provisions contained in latter law prevail to the former.<br><br>

The personal liberty of an individual so deprived of what so ever the reasons\ways can be corrected through the order of habeas corpus. Illegal detention or imprisonment, or detention without the base of law is a main ground of jurisdiction to habeas corpus. This rule is equally applicable to all the orders or decisions of ordinary Courts, special Courts, and tribunals, quasi-judicial or administrative authorities. Like no one is allowed to commit a crime, no authority is given a privilege to proceed the accused in a monopoly by ignoring the legal proceedings.<br><br>

The Court also held that the former decision was not binding so long as its contexts were different to the case that produced latter time. Even if the other legal remedy is available, the extra-ordinary jurisdiction may be exercised for the enforcement of fundamental rights. The Supreme Court may exercise its extra-ordinary jurisdiction even if the other legal remedy is available on the condition that fundamental right is violated. The Supreme Court cannot escape from its duties and responsibilities safeguarding the fundamental rights of the people on the ground that the other legal remedy is available to that effect.<br><br>

The Courts cannot help those who become unreasonably late to seek remedy in case the other person's night is affected to provide the remedy sought by such persons. But, if the Party is cautious in his rights and has not done late deliberately, he must not be deprived of getting equitable justice merely on the ground that he was being late to seek the remedy.

HMG, Council of Ministers and Others 2048 the popularly known to as the Ambassador Appointment Case, the news published by weekly "Matribhumi" quoting a Minister about the appointment of an ambassador by HM the King without advice or commendation of the Council of Ministers was the issue. The Court took help of Article35(6) of the Constitution and ruled that it was prohibited to raise any question on matters whether any advice or recommendation has been made to His Majesty, and if so, what advice or recommendation was offered by the Council of Ministers or any authority or official pursuant to this Constitution. Similarly Article41(2) prohibits raising any question on matters of compliance with HMG Conduct of Business Rules that regulates the procedures in respect of the presentation of advice and recommendation to HM by the Council of Ministers. The Supreme Court held that the right to information is not an absolute right. Article 16 of the Constitution qualifies the right through its proviso, which says that this Article shall not compel any one to provide information on any matter about which secrecy is to be maintained by law. The Court, in this case, darified that the right to information is subject to the limit imposed by

Article 4159 and Article 35 (6) of the Constitution 97 Though this case did not give any remedy to the petitioner who demanded information regarding the appointment of an ambassador, it settled some important issues related to the right to information. It rejected the claim for information relating to the privileged communication between His Majesty and King and the Council of Ministers. Similarly, it propounded a doctrine of "meaningful relation to file public interest litigation so It will be applicable in the right to information cases because most of the cases on the right to information have been filed under the banner of public interest litigation. It is because the right to information is confined to the information that is of public importance.<br><br>

Information that falls outside the ambit of public importance cannot be claimed under Article16. Thus, there is a good nexus between public interest litigation and the right to information. Given public interest Stigation, the Supreme Court minutely analysed the concept of public night or interest.599 The Court held that600 public right or interest indicates, dispute which is not limited to personal right or interest of a certain person or persons. It is related to collective right or interest of all people in general or of any community of people of the Kingdom of Nepal. If any person commits certain act in contravention of law and thereby causes some specific injury to a person or persons, such matter relates to the personal right or interest of such person or persons. Contrary to it if anyone, particularly HMG or any public institution or official, does not perform any

Article 41 states (1) The allocation and transaction of business of His Majesty's Government shall be carried out as set forth in rules approved by His Majesty, (2) No question shall be raised in any Court as to whether or not rules made pursuant to clause

No question shall be raised in any Court as to whether or not any recommendation or advice has been given to His Majesty pursuant to this Constitution by the Council of Ministers or any other institution or official, nor shall any question be raised in any Court about what recommendation or advice has been given.

act required to be performed under the Constitution or any law or performs t prohibited by the Constitution or the law and as a result thereof antes not a personal injury to any person or persons in the eyes of law any act sut bring adverse effect upon general interest or welfare of the general public, it becomes a matter of public right or interest. It is all probable that the interest or concern of a certain individual is mixed up or included within the collective right or interest of the general public. But the law does not recognize or protect such collective right or interest in the form of personal night or interest of the individual. The terms public right or interest does not relate the public right and interest to the numerical count of the people.<br><br>

The approach employed by the Supreme Court to determine public or private interest is based on its nature and relationship with public and not on numerical count. This approach of the Supreme Court seems relevant to determine the nature of information, whether it is of public importance or of private importance. It can be judged with the parameter of the Supreme Court's ruling in this case.<br><br>

The notion of locus standi developed by the Supreme Court in this Case is applicable in the case relating to the right to information. Even though. information having public importance can be demanded by any citizen. there are some implicit provisions, which should be honoured. Individual citizens cannot have a right to demand information out of curiosity. Public interest cannot be measured only by public nature of the information brought. To constitute public interest the public must have a meaningful relation with the information. The Supreme Court clarified that the dispute involving the right or concern of the public does not involve personal stake and issues of personal right or concern. Public right or interest involves collective right and concern of the people in general s<br><br>

The Court observed that the petitioner must show that he has a meaningful relation and substantial interest with the controversy that he has presented to the Court as justiciable controversy. He must also assure

wilbid

the Court that he can genuinely represent the people in general with a particular public right or concern. Thus, just a general interest or concer is not enough to prove his standing The Case is more important for limitations on the right to information. It

provides justification for cabinet information. The characteristics of the cabinet form of government where cabinet information needs some sort of confidentiality was examined and held that in the context of cabinet from the government adopted by our Constitution the personal opinion or views of any minister have no constitutional significance. The Constitution has installed the Council of Ministers as a collective body to be constituted under the leadership of the Prime Minister. The members of the Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to Parliament. Each and every act of the Council of Ministers is presumed to have been made with collective consensus of all ministers and all should collectively bear the responsibility thereof. As such the personal opinion or views of a minister have no value. The member of the Council of Ministers bearing such collective responsibility are not authorised without prior permission of the Prime Minister or of the Council of Ministers, to reveal publicly any opinion or views of oneself or of any ministerial colleague in respect of any act performed or to be performed by the Council of Ministers, nor any fact known by him or informed to him in the meetings of the Council of Ministers or in the context of inter department communications. The authority to inform publicly any opinion or decision of the Council of Ministers remains with the Council of Ministers or only with the Prime Minister. If any other minister has to inform publicly the opinion or decision of the Council of Ministers on any subject, either he has to be authorised by the Council of Ministers or he should receive prior permission from the Prime Minister. It is a constitutional convention that has been endorsed by our Constitution through the provision of oath of office and secrecy as contained in Article 40.<br><br>

From the observation of Bishwo Nath Upadhyaya, CJ, as stated above, this case supplied the nature of cabinet information and its disclosure. It emphasised on collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers

254pp



regarding cabinet information and made the Prime Minister an authorised person to work on behalf of the Council of Ministers. The Supreme Court left the matter to be decided by the Council of Ministers collectively whether it must divulge any information to the public.<br><br>

The Court further observed that each member of the Council of Ministers is bound by the oath of secrecy subscribed by him during his initiation as a minister to keep such matters in confidence. The duty of a minister to maintain secrecy of the information and records remains intact even after he is relieved from the post. The Court referred to the constitutional conventions developed in the United Kingdom while deciding this case. The Court cited an example of the United Kingdom where the cabinet form of government originated and flourished. In the United Kingdom the records of the meetings of earlier cabinet are not open even to the present Prime Minister and the existing cabinet without express approval of the then Prime Minister.604<br><br>

The Court realised the delicate nature of relationship between the constitutional monarch and the cabinet and refrained from issuing an order to keep the constitutional balance alive. It applied the concept of judicial self-restraint in this case. The Ambassador Appointment Case has provided a fresh impetus towards the democratic norms of the confidentiality of the business of the head of the government keeping delicate nature of such relationship in view.<br><br>

Court could do whatever it liked and wished. The judiciary could scrutinize the action and decision taken even by the Military Court if such action or decision were inconsistent with the Constitution. The Court, in this case, also observed that it was not reasonable to declare law ultra vires from the commencement of the Act so long as there had been alternation not to do so. This verdict of the Court has accepted that the parliament is a Supreme law making body and the function of the Court is merely to interpret it and not to amend or enact it.

Mana Bahadur Bishwokarma v. His Majesty's Government, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs and Others (2049);s18 is an another landmark case decided by the Supreme Court after the reinstatement of democracy in which the explanatory note of No. 10(A) of the Chapter on Adal of the Muluki Ain (the Country Code) was declared void from the date of its decision as it had contravened Article 11(4) including the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Article11 (4) prohibits discrimination on the basis of caste and treats untouchability as an offence. Denial of access to any public place or deprivations of the use of public utilities are made punishable by law. No. 10(A) of the Chapter on Adal of the Muluki Ain also carries the same sense. However, the explanatory provision of 10(A) had legitimized the practices traditionally adhered to in any temple or religious places as non-discriminatory. The Court stated that the explanatory note, which is sometimes, added with the actual provision, is part and parcel of the Section, as it clarifies the relevant Section. Explanatory clause is meant for the removal of dilemma and ambiguities, if any, under the actual provision of law. The explanation, therefore, cannot restrict nor can it widen the ambit of the actual provision of law. Here, No. 10(A) of the Chapter on Adal of the Muluki Ain was restricted by the explanatory clause as if it were the proviso of the general provision. With these lines, the Court observed that if the explanatory provision were allowed to remain in existence and operation, the fundamental character of the Constitution as the Supreme law was to disappear and the general law could prevail over the fundamental law of the land, and therefore, it must not be left in

operation.<br><br>

This is also one of the land mark decisions where the power of Judicial Review was exercised against the legislation by the Court. The general principle that the ordinary law cannot violate or go against the spirit of the Constitution is admitted by the Court in this case.<br><br>

There might also be differences between the people belonging to such classes. But the only requirement is that such a classification ought to be comprehensible and justifiable. However, any act indirectly downgrading a person who had received a Master's degree to a Bachelor level could not be deemed as reasonable and just. The legal provision regarding awarding marks only for Bachelor's degree to a person who had received a Master's degree, which had been already recognized by the authorized institution, obviously appeared to be controversial and unreasonable. The learned judges held that since such a classification about the qualification of the petitioners was apparently unjust, it was tantamount to the imposition of unreasonable restrictions on their qualifications in regard to the opportunities for promotion and, hence, it was declared ultra vires to the extent of inconsistency with the Constitution.<br><br>

in this case, the Court held despotism in against the doctrine of rule of law. The government cannot violate and infringe the right of the people conferred by the Constitution. The Act inconsistent with Constitution is void. The discretionary power should be reasonable and based on fairness and good faith. There can be Judicial Review on the decision of retire of the civil servant of the state. Absolute equality is often impossible. The equal protection of law implies to equal among equals.

This case provides the guideline to operate right to information issues in the realm.

If a right of an individual is abridged by using the authority of such inoperative law and if he files a writ petition to get remedy, Supreme Court has to decide the Constitutionality of the Act and on the remedy demanded.

In Advocate Bal Krishna Neupane v. HMG, Council of Ministers and Others 053), the constitutional validity of Sec.2 (d) (added by the first amendment), Sec. 4(1), (3), (4) and (5), the proviso to Sec. 12 and Sec. 19/12) of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Act, 1991 (2048) were challenged by the petitioner on the ground of their unconstitutionality with the provisions incorporated under Art. 12 of the Constitution relating to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. It was stated by the petitioner that the impugned provisions of the Act had made the constitutional provisions ineffective and meaningless. Particularly, Sec. 2(d) had unreasonably restricted the

jurisdiction of the CIAA.<br><br>

The Special Bench of the Supreme Court reasoned that the jurisdictions of the powers of the CIAA, which is a constitutional body, cannot be limited by an Act. If any kind of control or restriction either directly or indirectly is imposed on the CIAA, it contradicts the doctrine of constitutional supremacy and produces a bad effect on Article. 98(1), which emphatically describes the functions, duties and powers of the CIAA. The Court declared Sec. 4(5) of the CIAA Act, 1991 inconsistent with the Constitution, as it had restricted the CIAA to initiate any proceeding for the investigation of certain matters in particular circumstances,sss It also

declared proviso of Sec. 12 of the Act ultra vires the Article. 98(1), (2) and 1 of the Constitution as it had restricted the CIAA to take suo motto action. The Court also invalidated Sec. 19(12) of the Act which had prohibited the commission from taking any action against the political and in such cases the commission was required to write the Prime Minister. In case of any action against the Parliamentarians, the appointees commission was required to write the speaker of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the National Assembly for approval as per the requirement of the case. It was a great defect underlying the Act and a gross violation of principles of Natural Justice. If any action against a public authority is taken on the subjective satisfaction of a certain authority it is, in no way good for the fair administration nor is it required for the healthy progress of the democratic society and the rules of Natural Justice in such case become meaningless. The Court thus declared Sec.. 2d), Sec. 4(5), proviso of Sec. 12 and Sec. 19(12) inconsistent with Article. 98(1), (2) and (3) of the Constitution and highlighted the very importance of the CIAA institution constituted directly under the fundamental law of the land.

The Court by interpreting difference between Article 1 and Article 131 held that Article I was their for declaring any law null and void to the extent it is inconsistent with the Constitution whereas Article 131 made any law pso facto ineffective within one year if such law was inconsistent with the Constiution.<br><br>

According to the Court, the law which becomes automatically ineffective need not to be declared further void under Article 131. The rules of null and void are applied only to the case of effective law.<br><br>

The Court also held that it was up to the legislators to repeal or amend the law which was inconsistent with the Constitution under Article 131. The one year period of time was for legislators to think about and decide that whether such law needed to be repealed or amended. And in case such inconsistent law was not adjusted then the law would become automatically void within one year.<br><br>

The Court observed that the terms null and void expressed in Article 88(1)

and the term ineffective contained in Article 131 were not identical. The two terms connoted two different meanings. According to the verdict of the Court, Article 88(1) had a provision to declare inconsistent law null and void. But the pre-condition for the exercise of the Article was that it required post constitutional laws. Thus, the central verdict of the Court was to observe that Article 88(1) was for testing the validity of post constitutional laws whereas Article 131 was for testing the validity of pre constitutional laws.<br><br>

Within the tenure of 14 years of the enforcement of 1990 Constitution, hundreds of writ petitions seeking judicial remedy to enforce the fundamental rights have been moved to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has also played a predominant role in promoting and promoting such rights of the people. Some of the landmark judgments and trends marked by the Supreme Court on basic rights of the people can be discussed as follows:<br><br>

The Supreme Court in Sita Singh Poudel v. Public Service Commissions with reference to state obligations arising from Article3 and 4(1) (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the proviso to Article11(3) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990 held that the second amendment to the Civil Service Act which reduced the probation period of women employees from one year to six months was a positive discrimination envisaged in line with the Constitutional and international law schemes. To the Court, the provision of probation period contained in Section 18 of the Nepal Health Service Act, the real issue of the petition, was applicable only to the male employees. This was one of the judgments delivered by the Supreme Court of Nepal giving due consideration of the provisions of CEDAW.<br><br>

between men and women will be maintained. The Parliament responding to the ruling of the Court and other voices so raised in this regard later incorporated the provision of equal right of a male and female to ancestral property through 11th amendment to the Country Code.<br><br>

In Reena Bajracharya v. HMG and Others (20570, the Supreme Court, for the first time, examined the concept of gender justice and its application in Nepalese legal system. In this case, Rule 16.1.3 of the Service Rules of Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation Employees was challenged on the ground that the Rule had fixed different periods of service age for compulsory retirement to air steward and air hostess. Twenty eight air hostesses employed at the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) challenged the Rules as discriminatory and violative of their right to equality as it forced an air hostess to be relieved of her service if she attained the age of thirty or completed a total period of ten years in her job whereas the male crew members were allowed, as per rule 16.1.1 to continue their service until they reached fifty five. The petitioners pleaded that both airhostesses and stewards belonged to the crew service. and yet the airhostesses were subjected to blatant discrimination and forced to get early retirement merely on the ground of sex.<br><br>

Addressing the question of gender equality forcefully raised by the petitioners, a Special Bench held that although other provisions of the Service Rules concerning provident fund, other benefits and leaves were similar in case of both the airhostesses and the stewards, the impugned provision embodied in rule 16.1.3 appeared to be discriminatory and violative of the spirit of the Constitution. The Supreme Court also observed that the concept of equal pay for equal work guaranteed by Article11 (5) for both sexes was the fountain source of all other guarantees regarding their service facilities and securities. And, if there was equality in regard to the fundamental issue, it was but self-evident that the other related benefits, which flowed there from, such as, tenure of work, and the

resultant benefits, must also be equal. As a result, it stressed the need for e of equal benefits and security to every employee. The Supreme Court further opined that the provision enshrined in Article 11(2) and (3) assurance of the Constitution had embodied and assimilated the noble vision of elimination of sex discrimination between the opposite sexes and implementation of the culture of equal treatment in equal situations. The impugned rule 16.1.3 was also held to be in apparent contravention of the State Policy enshrined in Article. 26(7) of the Constitution which directed to pursue a policy of making the female population, to a great extent, in the task of national development by making special provisions for their education, health and employment.<br><br>

In Advocate Sapana Pradhan Malla vs. HMG and Others (2058ps relating to the issue of rape of prostitutes, the petitioner challenged the Constitutionality of No. 7 of the Chapter on Rape. The impugned No. 7 provided that a rape committed on a prostitute without her consent was punishable with a maximum penalty of up to Rs. 500|- or imprisonment up to one year whereas Section 3 of the Chapter on Rape provided a more stringent punishment for an offence of rape committed on women other than prostitutes-imprisonment ranging from six to ten years in case of the rape of a woman below 14 years of age and imprisonment ranging from three to five years in case of the rape of a woman above 14 years. The petitioner contended that it was contrary to the principle of criminal justice and CEDAW to make varying provisions of punishment for the same criminal act on the basis of the status of victims and, therefore, it infringed the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 11, 12(1) and 20 of the Constitution.<br><br>

The Special Bench observed that rape was a criminal and inhuman act which directly undermined the individual freedom and the right of self

Writ No. 56 of 2058 B.S.

determination to a woman. It was a crime not only against the victim lady rather also against the whole society. The physical suffering and mental trauma caused by this heinous crime are of the similar nature, irrespective of the fact whether the victim was a married or unmarried woman or a prostitute. A prostitute is also a human being and she possesses all human rights by virtue of being a human being. She has also got, like any other human being, the right to self-dignity, self determination and independent existence. Forcing, therefore, a woman to surrender herself against her wishes for use by some body constituted a grave violation of her right of leading a dignified life and self-determination and it also amounted to an insult to the human right of woman.<br><br>

The Supreme Court further observed that the Constitution has adopted the principles of non-discrimination whereby no body shall be deprived of equal protection of laws. Although equality means equality among the equals, however, depending on the prevailing conditions and circumstances sometimes just and reasonable classifications could also be made. Although Article11 (3) of the Constitution has given the scope for making positive discrimination, nonetheless it has not visualized for making negative discrimination. Hence, it is impossible to buy the discriminatory view that our Constitution has made any type of discrimination against prostitute woman. As the Constitution has not made any such discrimination, the discriminatory provisions made by law by classifying women into prostitutes and other women could not be treated as just and reasonable. The legal provision of lesser punishment for rapists of prostitutes tended to downgrade prostitutes, without any just or reasonable basis, to the position of women of lower status and made discriminatory treatment. The belief that there should be variations in punishment to be imposed to the convicts of crime committed against a particular category of people on the basis of their profession or their character would not be held as just or reasonable. The Justices were also of the opinion that if such a discriminatory legal provision were allowed to continue that would indirectly help encourage the rape of prostitutes.<br><br>

281pp





The Supreme Court further opined that coercion; threat and use of force constituted the core of the crime of rape. The "means rea" and "actus reus of the criminals were always similar in an act of rape committed on women, irrespective of their class. A legal provision for awarding lesser or greater punishment to criminals on the basis of the character or profession of the victims seemed to be discriminatory in view of the spirit of the Constitution, various International Covenants concerning women and human rights and the recognized principles of Justice. Hence, the Special Bench, issuing the writ, declared the impugned Section 7 as inconsistent with Article1 of the Constitution and declared it void under Article88(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Sabin Shrestha & Others us. Ministry of Labour & Transport Management & Others (20582 where the Section 12 of the Foreign Employment Act, 1985 was challenged as inconsistent with Articles 11, 12 (el and 17 of the Constitution of Nepal, the petitioner contended that since the impugned Section 12 stipulated that no employment agency should provide foreign employment to a woman without prior permission of her concerned guardian as well as of His Majesty's Government it was discriminatory towards women because it imposed unreasonable restrictions on their freedom of practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation. Responding to the writ petition, a Special Bench observed that the legal provision of Section 12 of the Foreign Employment Act, 2042 did not impose any restriction that a woman could never go out on a foreign employment or an authorized agency could never provide a foreign employment to a woman. Rather it simply created a procedural condition while granting foreign employment to a woman. The Bench held that it was the duty of every Welfare State to provide special protection to the interests of women, children and the aged and our Constitution too was

Supreme Court Bulletin, No. 19, at 4 (2058).

282pp




committed to this end by providing scope for making protective discrimination in Article11(3) of the Constitution. Hence, it was not proper to develop a negative perception of a particular law which had been pemulated with an objective to protecting such women, going on foreign employment, against prospective exploitation or fraud in the foreign countries,<br><br>

The Bench further held that it was a well-recognized principle of interpretation that in regard to interpretation and application of any law so far as the question of priority of the central provision and its proviso was concerned, it was the latter which took precedence over the former. And, the central provision alone could not be viewed independently and separately. Hence, the central provision of Article 11(3) of the Constitution ought to be viewed in the context of the proviso to that Article which provided for protection of the female class. Thus, since the impugned Act intended to protect the special interests of women by imposing some restrictions on the authorized employment agencies, it was erroneous to treat it as discriminatory on the ground of sex.<br><br>

The Supreme Court furthermore held that the proviso to Article 12 (2) (e) of 1990 Constitution empowered the State to make laws prescribing conditions for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation. Prescribing such condition could not be deemed as imposing restrictions on the enjoyment of the fundamental freedom guaranteed by Article 12 (2)(e) of the Constitution. Likewise, the right to property guaranteed by Article 17 (1) was available to the Nepalese citizens subject to the existing law. The procedural requirement imposed on an authorized foreign employment agency did not make any discriminatory treatment to women in regard to their right to acquire, own, sell or otherwise dispose of property. Hence, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the writ petition.<br><br>

The case of Tara Devi Poudyal vs. the Cabinet Secretariat & Others (2059 is something an indicator of the cautious hesitation of the Supreme Court of Nepal not to disturb the social and cultural values prevailing in the Nepalese society. In this case, the petitioner had challenged the Constitutionality of No. 4 of the Chapter on Incest of the Country Code as being inconsistent with Articles 11(1) (2) and (3) of the Constitution. The petitioner, the widow of a soldier in the Indian Army. claimed that she had married the younger brother of her dead husband in order to be eligible to claim the family pension under the Indian Army Pension Regulation Act, 1961 which provided that in the event of the death of a soldier if his widow got married to his younger brother she would be entitled to the family pension. She was being tried for incestuous marriage under a plaint filed by someone who was not an heir-copartner. The petitioner contended that since there was no legal prohibition on the marriage of a widower with the sister of his deceased wife, the penal provision of No. 4 of the Chapter on Incest was discriminatory between men and women.<br><br>

Responding to the writ petition, a five member Special Bench ruled that since the sister of a deceased wife was not a member of the family of the husband nor was she agnostic to him, it was not proper to treat a widower and a widow as being on the same footing in this regard. The right to equality means the equal application of law among the equals and not equal application and equal protection of the law among the unequal.<br><br>

The Bench further observed that a study of the Preamble to the Country Code revealed that some of its provisions had been influenced by the Hindu Dharmshastras. So as Article 19 of the Constitution of Nepal granted every person freedom to profess and practise his own religion as handed down to him from ancient times, having due regard to traditional practices, No. 10 (A) of the Chapter on Incest permitted incestuous sexual

284pp




relation or marriage between relations whose caste or racial practices had permitted such incestuous intercourse. But the purpose of the prohibiting of the impugned No 4 of the Chapter on Incest was to control adultery in the society and, therefore, it was not deemed proper to provision interfere with the wisdom of the Legislature in regard to such matters. The Bench further opined that under the Nepalese legal system after the death of a husband his assets and liabilities succeed to his widow who becomes a copartner in the family property. So long as she remained chaste to her husband and did not lose her chastity her relation with her dead husband remained as such. Thus, since while her relation with her dead husband continued to be the same as it was before, it was not lawful to say that her previous relationship of sister-in-law with the younger brother of her deceased husband did not continue to exist. The Supreme Court, therefore, ruled that the impugned Section 4 did not seem to impose any unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioner and thus it was not discriminatory.<br><br>

This unanimous decision of the Supreme Court may be laudable from a traditional Hindu viewpoint. But strong reservations can be put forward in regard to the appropriateness and suitability of the conservative value inherent in the ratio of the decision. In the modern times, the social reformers have been strongly advocating for eradication of the social evil of forcing a widow, even though she was young, not to get remarried. It is high time the willing widows were allowed to get married even to the brothers of their deceased husbands. Such a practice may also help further reintegration of the exiting family bond.<br><br>

discouraging such malpractices in light with the Constitution and ICERD The petitioners who belonged to the Dalit community of Siraha and Saptari districts were allegedly forced by the people belonging to the so called upper class of Hindus to do the menial service of disposing corpses (dead bodies) of animals. On their refusal to oblige they were subjected to social and financial boycott and segregation. Responding to the writ a Division Bench held that in view of the Constitutional petition, commitment towards eradication of the malpractice of untouchability and discrimination on the ground of caste it was not appropriate for Government offices like District Administration Office and District Police Office and local bodies like District Development Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committees to display apathy and negligence in carrying out their legal obligations. Those offices and institutions were duty bound to work towards eradication of untouchability and discrimination as enjoined by No. 10 (A) of the Chapter on Adal of the Country Code. The Supreme Court issued a directive order to the respondents instructing them to always remain active and alert in carrying out their legal obligation in this regard.<br><br>

In Krishna Prasad Shiwakoti Vs. HMG and Others (2059ps, the petitioner argued that Section 10 of the Chapter on Adal contravened the Constitutional provision of the right against discrimination guaranteed by Article 11(4) of the Constitution and sought the Supreme Court to declare ultra vires' of the Constitution. The petitioner also prayed it to issue a writ of mandamus to the respondents to make a law for the upliftment, protection and welfare of the Dalit community as well as another penal law for awarding punishment to the perpetrators of discrimination on the basis of caste.<br><br>

A Special Bench observed that Section 10 of the Chapter on Adal provided that no one shall do or cause to do any work by misleading or coercing

, thereby disturbing or damaging the social custom and practices of others. This legal provision simply prevented the act of disturbing social others, customs and practices. This provision seemed to be guided by the principle of not adversely affecting the rights and freedoms of others while exercising one's own rights. Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution, had also granted every person and denomination the right of protecting and promoting their culture, religion and tradition. The interference in the customs and practices of others could not be acceptable. The Special Bench, therefore, opined that the impugned Section 10 did not contravene the right against discrimination embodied in Article 11(4) of the Constitution.<br><br>

So far as the second question of making laws in accordance with Article 11 (3) and (4) was concerned, the Supreme Court held that the Constitution had entrusted responsibility to the Executive and the Legislature which could make protective legislation for the protection and promotion of the interests of women, children, the aged, the physically or mentally incapacitated persons or socially or educationally depressed classes or people. The Court opined that it shall be, therefore, neither appropriate nor Constitutional to issue instructions to make a special type of law in a situation where such a law was yet to be enacted.<br><br>

Similarly, in Durga Sob Vs. HMG and Others, (2059) dealing with almost an identical issue relating to the alleged unconstitutionality of Section 10 of the Chapter on Adal and the demand for framing of a special law relating to the creation of a National Commission for the Dalits, a Special Bench reaffirmed the principles initiated earlier in the preceding case of Krishna Prasad Shiwakoti, and dismissed the plea of the petitioner that the impugned Section 10 was unconstitutional.

person condemned to punishment according to the nature of the crime committed by him must be made to undergo the punishment in the similar manner. Higher education or higher living standard of a convict could not be a valid factor to detract from the punishment handed out to him. The Justices further observed that our Constitution did not permit such waiver, relaxation or special privilege to the people belonging to higher social status. It would tend to be discriminatory to differentiate between the people solely on the grounds of higher or lower status and also contrary to the spirit of the Constitution guided by the objective of the creation for an egalitarian society. Hence, the Supreme Court unanimously held the impugned provision contained in clause (1) of rule 21 of the Prison Rules, 1963 as repugnant to Articlell (3) of the Constitution and rendered it derecognized and ineffective in view of the provision of Article. 131 of the Constitution. However, it is highly regrettable that although this decision had been made on June 3, 2000, the alleged discriminatory treatment is still being generally carried out in practice in various prisons.<br><br>

In Ishwari Prasad Sangraula u. the Britain Nepal Medical Trust (2056), the Supreme Court held that no right (including the Right to Equality) could be created by resorting to the means of a prerogative writ. On the contrary it is only a right already established under law that could be enforced by the means of writ. The petitioner who had been hired by the respondent BNMT as a training coordinator for a fixed period of three years on a monthly salary of Rs. 24,000/- had subsequently sued the BNMT for discriminating against him in respect of remuneration as compared to other foreigner trainers who were paid higher salaries. Dismissing the writ petition, the Division Bench held that since the petitioner had entered into the service of the Trust by willingly accepting the terms and conditions of the contract he had no legal ground to claim that he had been subjected to inequality and discrimination in respect of

Article from addressing the public interest related to equality right; the Supreme Court has also granted relief to several individuals whose equality right had been infringed by the State. One such notable example is the case of Hari Ram Koirala v. HMG and Others. The petitioner, an engineer by profession, had earlier challenged the decision of the Promotion Committee recommending the name of five candidates for promotion to five Gazette First Class Posts under Nepal Engineering Service and the subsequent rejection of his appeal against that decision by the Public Service Commission in the Supreme Court which had quashed those decisions and issued a writ of mandamus to the Public Service Commission to decide the complaint of the petitioner. A revised decision of the Public Service Commission recommended the names of five candidates for promotion including that of the petitioner. But this time, the persons who had been given appointment earlier were allowed to have their seniority counted from Jyestha 17, 2052 BS whereas in the case of the petitioner the date of his seniority was made to be effective only from Ashwin 25, 2056 B.S. the date on which the revised list was published in the Gorkhapatra, a national newspaper. The Full Bench ruled that the decision fixing different effective dates of seniority for different candidates promoted to similar posts under an advertisement of the same date as per the same decision of the Public Service Commission and included in the same revised list of the Promotion Committee amounted to unequal treatment among the equals. Hence, the defendants were instructed to treat the petitioner on the equal footing with his promoted colleagues and to count his seniority from the date which had been applicable in the case of the latter.<br><br>

In recent years the rights and welfare of children have increasingly engaged the attention of the child rights activists in particular and the society in general. A few cases were brought before the Supreme Court seeking rulings on some related issues. In Aashish Adhikari on behalf of Keshav Khadka V. Dhankuta District Court & Others (2057)to a Division Bench held the detention of a minor, Keshav Khadka, in prison, as illegal, and directed the concerned authorities of His Majesty's Government to make necessary arrangements for his stay in some Child Reform House. Section 15 of the Act Relating to Children, 1991 provides that a minor sentenced to imprisonment must not be placed in the prison along with adult prisoners. Rather such a minor must be kept separately in Child Reform House as required by Section 42 of the Act. so long as such a Child Reform House was not set up, minors may be temporarily entrusted to the care of child Welfare Centres, orphanages or the like, privately run by other people. This very principle had been earlier affirmed by a Division Bench in Aashih Adhikari in favour of Bablu Godiya v. Banke District Court & Others571,<br><br>

In Tarak Dhital & Others V. Chief District Administrator of Kathmandu & Others (205772 the Supreme Court displayed its concern and sensitivity towards exploitation and torture meted out minors and the to infringement of their rights embodied in the Act Relating to Children, 1991. It is worth recalling that a few years back the national dailies caused a shocking sensation by headlining the revealing news of the exploitation of a twelve year old child named Dheeraj K.C. who had been forcibly kept as a domestic servant by Madhusudan Nakarmi who used to keep the poor child all fettered in chains and locked him inside his department when he used to be out to attend his office. The Justices directed Kathmandu District Court to re-register the case kept dormant quite for some time and to give priority in disposal of that case.<br><br>

Chandra Nath Sapkota Vs. Home Ministry & Others (2058, the petitioner alleged that the respondent Home Ministry had cancelled the registration of Child Awareness Group in contravention of Article12 (2)(c) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal and Article 15 (1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. Responding to the writ petition, a Division Bench observed that a citizen's freedom to form union and association guaranteed by Article 12 (2) (c) of the Constitution could be reasonably restricted only under laws made under provisos to that Art. Nonetheless, the State could not impose restrictions on such a freedom without making a law to that effect. The freedom of forming unions or associations was available to every Nepali citizen. And the word "citizen" mentioned in Article 12 (2) did not discriminate between a minor boy and a minor girl nor did it deprive a minor of his/her right to form a union or association. Whereas Article11 (3) of the Constitution had enjoined on the State to make special protective provisions for the protection and development of children, it was not at all proper to cancel the registration of the above mentioned Child Awareness Group, which had been already set up by the children themselves and even renewed for the promotion of the interests and welfare of children, only because its membership comprised of minors.<br><br>

The declaration of the state of emergency on November 26,2001 throughout the country resulted the suspension of the fundamental rights enshrined in Articles 12 (a) (b) and (d), 13(1), 15,16,17,22 and 23 (except the right to the remedy of habeas corpus). The suspension of Article23 (the Right to Constitutional Remedy) of the Constitution confronted the Supreme Court with a question whether the writ petitions already filed in the Supreme Court under Article23 before the declaration of emergency could be further proceeded with. On a reference made in connection with a

writ petition, Madan K.C. v. the Land Reform Office a five Justice Special 1 Bench ruled that in the absence of any express Constitutional restriction on the hearing of the writ petitions registered before the declaration of the state of emergency and already under the consideration before the Supreme Court, there was no Constitutional impediment in the hearing of such writ petitions. The similar kind of issue was raised and settled accordingly by the Supreme Court during the time of emergency imposed on Feb. 1, 2005.<br><br>

Ever since the promulgation of the 1990 Constitution, the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed in several cases relating to preventive detention that there must be obvious and logical connection between the object for putting someone in detention and the reason and ground for such a detention. If the need for putting in preventive detention does not seem to exist objectively, the detention becomes vitiated and unlawful. Departing to its recent judicial tradition of enquiring about whether or not there is apparent existence of sufficient and reasonable prima facie ground for preventive detention, the Supreme Court, in the preceding year, granted relief to several aggrieved persons by ordering their release from illegal detention. In Kalpana Subedi v. HMG and Others675, Umesh Kumar Sah u HMG and Others676, and Hasta Bahadur BK v. HMG and Others? the Supreme Court held that so long as there were not sufficient grounds to prove as to which acts of the detainee caused immediate threat to the sovereignty, integrity or law and order situation of the Kingdom of Nepal, one could not be deprived of his her precious personal liberty. For the lack of sufficient grounds the Supreme Court held those detentions as illegal and violative of Article 12(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

But when such sufficient grounds were presented to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court, the detention had been held lawful. For example, in Shanti Prajuli v. HMG & Others674, a Division Bench held that since the detainee had confessed before the Police that, under the directions of her husband who was an underground Maoist activist, she had been actively involved in the Maoist activities directed against the present political system and also because she had been caught red-handed wearing Maoist uniform and possessing some banners containing Maoist slogans, her preventive detention by the Chief District Officer under Section 3.1 of the Public Security Act, 1989 could not be held as unjustified and without sufficient grounds.<br><br>

Similarly, in Rameshwar Chaulagai & Others v. District Administration Office of Sindhupalchowk,679 a Division Bench of the Supreme Court declared the detention of the petitioner as illegal because, although charged with an offence under the Arms and Ammunition Act, 1962 punishable with a maximum imprisonment of two years and a fine up to Rs. 1,200/-, he had been kept in judicial custody pending trial of his case, for more than two years and four months obviously a period longer than the one prescribed by the law even in case of his possible conviction.<br><br>

In Kashi Dahal v. HMG Secretariat of the Council of Ministers and others (20590, popularly known to as the Lumbini Case, the petitioner had prayed the Supreme Court under its extraordinary jurisdiction to issue an order to provide information relating to why the decision to chop down the sacred 'Pipal' tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha at Lumbini was taken in addition to translocation of the temple of Mayadevi. The petitioner had contended that the sacred "Pipal" tree and Mayadevi temple are important national heritage and destruction of or tampering with these historic resources is tantamount to doing an annihilation of the historic and culturally sensitive assets.<br><br>

In this case, the petitioner approached the Court on the basis of news published by two weekly newspapers called "The Rastrapukar" and "The Nepal Jagaran" that published news about the chopping down of the pipal tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha. These newspapers raised the issue that the stem and branches of the chopped down pipal tree were being smuggled in the name of Lord Buddha and an enormous amount of money had been illegally collected by the authority of Lumbini Development Fund.<br><br>

In the written statement submitted by the respondents in the Supreme Court it was stated that the respondents informed the public regarding such activities from time to time. However, the respondents could not produce any evidence to support this contention. So, the Court did not agree with the plea of the respondents and ordered the respondents to divulge publicly the reasons why the sacred pipal tree needed to be chopped down and idols of Mayadevi temple to be shifted from there. Krishna Jung Rayamajhi, J. held that it was the duty of the agencies concerned to immediately execute flow of information to public in general on the matter of archaeological, religious and historic interests.<br><br>

Article 17 of the Constitution which guarantees the Right to Property has three facets. Clause (1) guarantees, every citizen, to have, subject to the existing laws, the right to acquire, own, sell and otherwise dispose of property. Clause (2) forbids the State to, except in the public interest, requisition, acquire or create any encumbrance on the property of any person. And clause (3) provides for enacting law to prescribe the basis of compensation and procedure for giving compensation for any property requisitioned, acquired or encumbered by the State in the public interest. The Supreme Court, in light of Article 17 of the Constitution has made a number of pronouncements some of which occupy the important place in human rights jurisprudence. Notably, the Supreme Court in Mithilesh Kumar Singh case interpreted that the right to property was (though the Constitution makes it a fundamental right) merely a legal right.<br><br>

Lalit Bahadur Khatri V.HMG & Others the Supreme Court granted relief to the petitioner whose landed property had been held in possession His Majesty's Government for a considerable period of time without completing the other necessary formalities required by the law. In order to set up entertainment plaza at four places around the Ring Road the Ministry of Works and Transport had published a notification some 21 back under Section 7(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1977 to acquire years some land including that of the petitioner. But thereafter the Ministry did not care to proceed further to provide compensation or another land in return for the land so acquired to the concerned owners as stipulated by Section 12 of the Act. This showed that the act of acquisition had not been performed by completing all the requirements stipulated by the law. The Division Bench, held that so long as the legal procedures were not complied with in accordance with the law, the private property of a citizen could not be treated as lawfully acquired by the State in the public interest. So, the Supreme Court issued a writ of mandamus directing the concerned Ministry to vacate the lawful possession of disputed land of the petitioner. This decision appears to be an instance of vindication of a citizen's right to property by the Supreme Court.<br><br>

In Binod Prasad Mainali & Others V. HMG & Others a Special Bench quashed a writ petition seeking relief of due compensation for the land of the petitioners on which some sort of encumbrance had been created by the State. In this case the Nepal Electricity Authority and its High Voltage Consolidation Project had restrained the petitioners, under the authority granted by Section 33(3) of the Electricity Act, 1992, from undertaking any construction work or planting any tree within 9 meters on each side of the middle line over which the electric voltage wire was to pass through. Since, the concerned authorities had refused to pay any compensation and intended to pay only 10% damage for such land, the petitioners pleaded that their land could not be acquired in public interest without eving them due compensation as guaranteed by Article. 17(3) of the

Constitution. But the Justices held that such an act of the respondents did not amount to acquisition of the disputed land of the petitioners as they were at liberty to undertake general cultivation on the land. Also, since their ownership remained unaffected and they had been allowed damage to the tune of 10% there was no legal substance in the plea of the petitioners. However, awarding damage to the tune of a meager 10% for creating encumbrance on a precious piece of land, which was meant for use for residential purpose in a metropolitan city like Kathmandu could be hardly justified. The Supreme Court could not display proper sensitively to appreciate the proportion of damage suffered by the petitioners.<br><br>

In Gyan Raj Ras a question was raised- whether or not there can be judicial review of treaty law. In this case, a Nepalese citizen who was retired from British Army alleged that there was discrimination and wide disparity between British Citizens and Nepalese citizens in the matter of promotion, pension and other facilities. The basis of recruitment of Nepalese citizens in the British Army is a treaty concluded between Nepal, Britain and India on 9 November 1990. In the said Treaty inter alia a Treaty concluded between Britain and India on 7 November 1947 was annexed. The annexed treaty has made a provision of application of Indian Pay Code to the Nepalese citizens working in the British Army. The petitioner has claimed that the provision of treaty is adversely affecting to the Nepalese nationality and the state has filed to provide equal treatment to the citizens working in the British army. He pleaded the Court that the discriminatory treatments are based on a treaty and any treaty entered by Nepal is applicable, as Nepal law and the provision be declared void on the ground of inconsistency with the Constitution. He further demanded for issuing of an order to the government for making necessary legal and diplomatic efforts to provide equal treatment to the petitioner and other Nepalese citizens of the same footing.<br><br>

THE ASSESSMENT OF THE PRACTICE OF JUDICIAL REVIEW IN

NEPAL<br><br>

6.1 General Overview<br><br>

Judicial review which invokes about right to remedies is the corner stone of all other fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Article 32 and 107 of the Constitution are basis of judicial review in Nepal. The right embodied in Article 32 of the Constitution can be invoked to seek the intervention of the Supreme Court in the manner set forth in Article 107 for the enforcement of the fundamental rights of the people. Article 107 provides for the most effective and powerful weapon of judicial review at the disposal of the Supreme Court to protect and promote the fundamental rights of the people and the rule of law as envisaged by the Preamble. It is gratifying to note that in the recent years the apex Court seems to have displayed greater sensitivity and commitment to the protection of the rights of the people and promotion of the rule of law in the country. That the judiciary is always regarded as "the light at the end of the tunnel" is indicative of the trust of the people reposed in this great institution. The recent judicial activism and judicial assertion displayed by the Supreme Court of Nepal augurs well for the consolidation of judicial independence and promotion of democratic values and culture. Nevertheless, the apex judiciary cannot afford to be complacent or slack. It must also show the grit and determination to afford quicker and cheaper justice to the Court users. Was it not Francis Bacon who declared long back, "Fresh justice is the sweetest"<br><br>

6.2 Constraints of the System of Judicial Review<br><br>

A survey of the contemporary trends and practices on a system of judicial review carried out in the study reveal that almost all the petitions of judicial review have been found quashed on the ground of laches of time, non-compliance of the rules of natural justice and non-application of judicial mind, availability of alternative remedy, issue of the question of fact, issue of adverse impact violation of rights, issue of established rights, issue of sub-judice case, issue of locus standi and so forth. These grounds are mostly technical rather than the substantive ones.<br><br>

Another limitation evolved by the Court in the practice of judicial review is the issue of question of fact.

It has pronounced in a number of cases that the writ petition involved with question of fact was not subjected to judicial review.<br><br>

Another jurisprudence developed by the Court in the exercise of judicial review is the issue of adverse impact or infringement on the enjoyment of rights conferred on by the law and constitution.

The trends of Court in the current days and even to date reveal that one has to establish his/her undisputed rights to claim for enforcement of their rights on judicial review via writ petition. There are a number of instances where the Court has dismissed petitions on the ground that the petitioner failed to establish rights for the purpose of seeking remedy on judicial review. The Sant Kumar Rai v. Main Forest Office, Biratnagar and Others (2036)731; Gopal Singh Goin Bista v. HMG, Ministry of Forest and Others (2040)732; Mahendra Singh Yetwal v.

The issue of sub-judice is another constraint developed by the Court in the area of judicial review. The Court has categorically spoken in a number of cases that it cannot provide any remedy or exercise the power of judicial review in case the impugned issue before it is sub-judice in any other Court or benches. The cases like Ramkaji Pradhananga v. Hemraj Bajracharya and Others (2034)739; Ratanial Kediya v. Chhatra Bahadur Puri (2038)40 Shivlal Acharya v.

It has categorically pronounced in several judgments that the writ cannot be issued to enforce the contractual liabilities.<br><br>

6.3 Assessment of the Progress of Judicial Review<br><br>

Over the half decade of the practice of judicial review in Nepal, thousands of writ petitions have been moved to the Court of Nepal. These are mostly, by virtue of very nature and aim of a system of judicial review, sought for the enforcement of basic rights, for the safeguard of the Constitution and for protection of overall justice system of a nation. Some of the landmark pronouncements and rulings held by the Court to date have helped to

action sought to be adjudicated in the proceedings. (See, Bry A. Garner, Black's Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition West Group at 952 (1999).<br><br>

The traditional rule of standing stipulates that only the aggrieved person" can ordinarily move to a court with a writ of certiorari, prohibition or mandamus. This principle is based on the theory that remedies and rights are correlative and therefore, only a person whose own right is in jeopardy is entitled to seek a remedy. This basic rule gives rise to three propositions of law. The first being that one can take recourse to the writ jurisdiction whose oun legal rights are directly and substantially injured. Secondly, when a person suffers along with other members of the public by administrative action, he cannot challenge the dation in question unless he can show some special injury to himself over and above what others have suffered. And, thirdly, where a person challenging an administrative action is a total stranger, the court will not ordinarily entertain his petition.<br><br>

This narrower view of the law of Standing leads to several consequences. For example, in some cases there may not be anyone having standing to challenge the administrative action and the concerned administrative authority may consequently be continued on its wrongful action as being free from all sort of fear of anyone's challenges. It will invite public injures Msulting in mass suffering. Similarly, the poor will unable to seek redress of their grievances. Much confusion is caused at present because of the idea of i) standing and i) Justifiability. When a person is found to have no justifiable right, his petition may be rejected by the court on the ground either of lack of Standing or lack of a justifiable cause.<br><br>

evolve an integrated system of judicial review in Nepal. The noticeable achievements and trends marked by the Court by exercising the power of judicial review in response to defend fundamental rights of the people can be analyzed as follows. The principal progress achieved by the Court is related to defend of the fundamental rights; the principle of ultra-vires; rules of natural justice and so forth.<br><br>

6.3.1 On Basic Rights of the People<br><br>

The principle progress made in regard to basic rights of the people is related to right to equality, principle of non-discrimination, right to freedom and personal liberty, freedom of information, right to environment, and so forth.<br><br>

6.3.1.1 Right to equality and Principle of Non-discrimination<br><br>

Right to equality before the law and equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Article 11 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990 embodies the fundamental principle of equality and its integral relationship with justice. Clause (2) of the Article further prohibits any kind of discrimination on grounds of religion, race, sex, caste, tribe or ideological conviction. The Supreme Court of Nepal has constantly spoken in favour of the right to equality over the years and developed some trends on judicial review.<br><br>

The Supreme Court in Sita Singh Poudel v. Public Service Commission4 with reference to state obligations arising from Article 3 and 4(1) (2) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to which Nepal is a party and the proviso to Article 11(3) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal 1990 held that the second amendment to the Civil Services Act which reduced the probation period of women employees from one year to six months was a positive

discrimination upheld in line with the Constitutional schemes. With this interpretation, the Court held that the provision of probation period contained in section 18 of the Nepal Health Services Act was applicable only to the male employees. This was one of the judgments delivered by the Supreme Court of Nepal responding to the CEDAW.<br><br>

In Iman Singh Gurung49, after the advent of the new Constitution, for the first time, the Supreme Court declared the clause (d) of section (1)(3) of the Military Act, 201670 void from the date of the decision, as being contrary to Article 11(1) of the Constitution. In this case the Court held that the Constitution had restriction on the power of the Court in interfering the proceedings and decisions of the Military Court, however, it did not mean that the military Court could do whatever it liked and wished. The judiciary could scrutinize the action and decision taken by the Military Court if such action or decision was inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution. The Court also observed that it was not just to declare law ultra vires from its commencement so long as the alternate was available. This verdict accepted that the parliament was a supreme law making body and the function of the Court was merely to interpret it.<br><br>

Emphasizing the importance of natural justice the Court stated that presentation of evidence, an opportunity of legal aid and fairness in the legal proceeding were all necessary requirement of justice and these prerequisites of a system of natural justice could be maintained only by the competent, independent and impartial Court or Tribunal. The Court farther pronounced that a citizen had right to go to the independent and

competent Court or judicial body for the determination of his basic rights and duties and these requirements of a citizen could not be infringed without essential or justified reason.<br><br>

Man Bahadur Biswokarma V. HMG751 is an another landmark case decided by the Supreme Court after the reinstatement of democracy in which the explanatory clause of no. 10(a) of the Miscellaneous Chapter of the Muluki Ain (the Country Code) was declared void from the date of its decision as it had contravened Art. 11(4) as well as the letter and spirit of the Constitution. Art. 11 (4) prohibits discrimination on the basis of caste and treats untouchability as an offence. Denial of access to any public place or deprivations of the use of public utilities are made punishable by law. No. 10(a) of the Miscellaneous Chapter of the Muluki Ain also carries the same sense. The explanatory provision of 10(a) had legitimized the practices traditionally adhered to in any temple or religious places as non discriminatory. The Court stated that the explanation of a section, which is, sometimes, added with the actual provision, is part and parcel of the section, as it clarifies the relevant section. Explanatory clause is meant for the removal of dilemma and ambiguities, if any, under the actual provision of law. The explanation, therefore, cannot restrict nor can it widen the ambit of the actual provision of law. Here, No. 10(a) of the Miscellaneous Chapter of the Muluki Ain was restricted by the explanatory clause as if it were the proviso of the general provision. The Court observed that if the explanatory provision was allowed to remain in existence and operation, the fundamental character of the Constitution as the supreme law was to disappear and the general law could prevail over the fundamental law of the land.<br><br>

This is a second litigation where the power of judicial review of legislation was exercised against the legislation by the Court after the advent of the new Constitution and declared the explanatory clause of No. 10(a) of the Miscellaneous Chapter of the Muluki Ain void.<br><br>

Responding to the Petition, written replies and the arguments submitted by learned advocates, the bench framed the issue that whether or not the explanatory clause of No 10(A) of the chapter on conduct of the country code is contrary to Art 11(4) of the Constitution. With reference to this fundamental issue, the bench ruled that with an objective to avoid ambiguity in any section of the Act, in the process of enacting law, the explanatory clause is contained where there is chance of such ambiguity or confusion. Such explanatory clause becomes an integral part of the concerned section. Such clause does not narrow or extend the scope of concerned section. Such clause should be read or in assumed that it has been contained for the purpose of clarifying the main section. So far as the main section of No 10(A) of the chapter on conduct of the legal code and its explanatory clause are concerned, the former has contained that it shall be punishable crime if any person on the basis of caste discriminates against as untouchable or makes deny access to any public place or makes deprivation of the use of public utilities, whereas the latter contains that tradition accustomed as traditionally shall not be regarded as discriminatory practice, which has encouraged the discriminatory practice over temples or religious places. Thus, the impugned explanatory clause of No 10(A), containing a definition of discriminatory acts, has narrowed down and restricted the scope of the main section. The explanatory clause cannot extend or limit the scope of the meaning of law. This function has to be done by provision of any substantive section or sub-section. As the section 10(A) has been designed to specify the punishment for the action prohibited by Art 11(4) of the Constitution, this is not appropriate to perform its function in lime with the name as entitled and the purpose for end or limit the scope of Art 11(4) by the said No 10(A), The Act should which it is enacted. Explanatory clause of the No. 10(A) seems to have carried out the function of proviso. It has also enshrined self-contained provision.<br><br>

Provided that the purpose of explanatory clause is not to manage Exceptional provision. When the exceptional legal provision causes otherwise to the general exception provision, the Constitution lies under

310pp <br><br>



the control of general law, which is contrary to the spirit and letter of Art I of the Constitution of the kingdom of Nepal and contrary to the whole norms of the Constitution. When the law maintains exception to the provision of the Constitution, the fundamental distinction between law and Constitution may disappear, and there shall be chance of encroachment upon the supremacy of Constitution. Consequently, the Constitutional mechanism making articles of fundamental rights non amendable shall be defeated and the law shall amend the Constitution. Thus, since the impugned explanatory clause seems to have performed act to narrow down the scope of Art 11(4) of the Constitution, the explanatory clause of No 10(A) of the Chapter on Conduct is, to this extent, contrary to the Constitution. Now, therefore, the explanatory clause of No 10(A) as mentioned above, by the exercise of power of the Court conferred under Art 88(1) of the Constitution of the kingdom of Nepal, has been declared null and void effective from the date..<br><br>

The Supreme Court in Meera Dhungana752 where a petition was filed by some women activists with a reference to the CEDAW seeking the Supreme Court to declare some provisions of the Country Code which discriminated female and male members of the joint family null and void, the five-member bench of the Supreme Court decided to issue a directive order to the Government to introduce appropriate legislation within one year so that a just and balanced scheme between men and women will be maintained. In Dr. Chandra Bajracharya's like in Meera Dhungana, a petition was filed by the petitioner seeking the Supreme Court to declare some provisions of the civil code which discriminated the male and the female, The Court scrutinizing the claimed raised by petitioner held a directive order to the Government to introduce appropriate legislation in the parliament within two year. These cases are examples of how the Court is active in implementing the CEDAW into national situation.<br><br>

In Reena Bajracharya74, the Supreme Court, for the first time, examined the concept of gender justice and its application in Nepalese legal system. In this case, Rule 16.1.3 of the Service Rules of the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation Employees Rules was challenged on the ground that the Rules had fixed different periods of service age for compulsory retirement to air steward and air hostess. Twenty eight air hostesses employed at the Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC) challenged the Rules as discriminatory and violative of their right to equality as it forced an air hostess to be relieved of her service if she attained the age of thirty or completed a total period of ten years in her job whereas the male crew members were allowed, as per rule 16.1.1 to continue their service until they reached fifty five. The petitioners pleaded that both airhostesses and stewards belonged to the crew service, and yet the airhostesses were subjected to blatant discrimination and forced to get early retirement plainly on the ground of sex.<br><br>

Addressing the question of gender equality forcefully raised by the petitioners, a Special Bench held that although other provisions of the Service Rules concerning provident fund, other benefits and leaves were similar in case of both the airhostesses and the stewards, the impugned provision embodied in rule 16.1.3 appeared to be discriminatory and violative of the spirit of the 1990 Constitution.<br><br>

The Apex Court also maintained that the concept of equal pay for equal work guaranteed by Article 11(5) for both sexes was the fountain source of all other guarantees regarding their service facilities and securities. And, if there was equality in regard to the fundamental issue, it was but self evident that the other related benefits, which flowed there from, such as, tenure of work, and the resultant benefits, must also be equal. As a result, it stressed the need for assurance of equal benefits and security to every employee. The Apex Court further opined that the provision enshrined in Article 11(2) and (3) of the new Constitution had embodied and assimilated the noble vision of eradication of sex discrimination between

312pp


the opposite sexes and implementation of the culture of equal treatment in equal situations. The impugned rule 16.1.3 was also held to be in apparent contravention of the State Policy enshrined in Art, 26(7) of the Constitution which directed to pursue a policy of making the female population participate, to a great extent, in the task of national development by making Special provisions for their education, health and employment.<br><br>

The Court, by highlighting the importance of gender equality observed that equality is the heart of every democratic from of government. Men and women are the part and parcel of humanity. Therefore, it is undisputed fact on humanitarian ground that men and women should be equally granted their rights to survive in the human world. The phenomenon of granting rights to them on similar footing is natural and cannot be avoided. Referring to the Constitution of Nepal, the Court expressed that the Constitution is recent and made by contemplating all the modern concepts of human rights recognized in the international world. Therefore, it abolishes discrimination against women, which is enshrined under provisions of Art. 11(3), Arts. 26(7) and 11(5) of the Constitution as these Articles provide for special provision to be made by law for the protection and advancement of the interests of women, their education, health and employment and their equal remuneration for the same work. The Court furthermore emphatically stated that the importance of basic human rights like gender equality has its remote effect on the development of the human life in the aggregate, therefore, even a little smell of gender discrimination in law or legal proceeding should not be allowed as gender equality is the subject of humanity and thus a subject of common interest equally valuable for all.<br><br>

A survey of international human rights instruments especially related to the rights of women of which Nepal is a party was made in this case. The Court also held that section 9 of the Nepal Treaties Act, 2047 had given a superior status to the UN human rights instruments of which Nepal is a party than the ordinary law. It was observed in the case that the proviso to Article 13(3) of the Constitution is of positive nature and not preventive. It does not allow enacting law for providing less benefit and protection to

woman than man. The respondent in the case claimed that the petitioners had accepted the terms and conditions at the time of entry to the service, hence, they are prevented to challenge the rule on the ground of estoppels. The Court held that whatever the method of entry be when one gets the status of permanent employee he is regulated by the service security rules and there is no Estelle in legal matters. The Court found that the petitioners are in same position to their male counterparts and the provision of the Rule 16.1.3 is contrary to gender equity and inconsistent with the Constitutional provision and held void ab initio.<br><br>

This landmark decision delivered by the Supreme Court is significant in two respects. Firstly, the Apex Judiciary, for the first time, seems to have displayed greater sensitivity to the issue of gender equality and greater commitment to the eradication of gender discrimination. Secondly, it also registered a marked shift in the indirect and circumlocutory approach in regard to gender issues displayed hitherto by the Apex Court in earlier cases of similar nature, such as, Andrew Swarjman V. Department of Immigration and Others (1994),755 Meera Khanal V. His Majesty's Government (HMG) and Others (1995)756 and Dr. Chanda Bajracharya V. Parliament Secretariat and Others (1996),757 In this case, the Court had also upheld the monistic prism of the international law jurisprudence. However, on the contrary to this case, the Court in a case filed by an advocate Chandra Kant Gyanwali seeking for an order of Mandamus to be sued to the Government to confer citizenship even on the basis of mother's citizenship, the supreme Court by applying the dualistic prism of the international law held that the Constitution was a supreme law of the land and a provision of the Constitution cannot be declared void on the ground that the same is inconsistent with another provision of the Constitution. It also held that since Article 11 of the Constitution guaranteed equality to all citizens, there could be no discrimination on the basis of sex while conferring citizenship among citizens.<br><br>

In Hari Ram Koirala v. HMG and Others7s apart from addressing the public interest related to equality right, the Supreme Court of Nepal has also granted relief to several individuals whose equality right had been infringed by the State. The petitioner, an engineer by profession, had earlier challenged the decision of the Promotion Committee recommending the name of five candidates for promotion to five Gazette First Class posts under Nepal Engineering Service and the subsequent rejection of his appeal against that decision by the Public Service Commission in the Supreme Court which had quashed those decisions and issued a writ of mandamus to the Public Service Commission to decide the complaint of the petitioner. A revised decision of the Public Service Commission recommended the names of five candidates for promotion including that of the petitioner. But this time the persons who had been given appointment earlier were allowed to have their seniority counted from Jyestha 17, 2052 BS whereas in the case of the petitioner the date of his seniority was made to be effective only from Ashwin 25, 2056 B.S. the date on which the revised list was published in the Gorkhapatra, a national newspaper. A Full Bench ruled that the decision fixing different effective dates of seniority for different candidates promoted to similar posts under an advertisement of the same date as per the same decision of the Public Service Commission and included in the same revised list of the Promotion Committee amounted to unequal treatment among the equals. Hence, the defendants were instructed to treat the petitioner on the equal footing with his promoted colleagues and to count his seniority from the date which had been applicable in the case of the latter.<br><br>

In Advocate Sapana Pradhan Malla v. HMG and Others 759 relating to the issue of rape of prostitutes, the petitioner challenged the Constitutionality of Section 7 of the chapter on Rape. The impugned Section 7 provided that rape committed on a prostitute without her consent was punishable with

wid No. 3. F.N. 237, at 1. Writ No. 56 of 2058 BS.

315pp




a maximum penalty of up to Rs. 500- or imprisonment up to one year whereas Section 3 of the chapter on Rape provided a more stringent punishment for an offence of rape committed on women other than prostitutes-imprisonment ranging from six to ten years in case of the rape of a woman below 14 years of age and imprisonment ranging from three to Ere years in case of the rape of a woman above 14 years. The petitioner contended that it was contrary to the principle of criminal justice and CEDAW to make varying provisions of punishment for the same criminal act on the basis of the status of the victims and, therefore, it infringed the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 11, 12(1) and 20 of the present Constitution of Nepal.<br><br>

The Special Bench observed that rape was a criminal and inhuman act which directly undermined the individual freedom and the right of self determination to a woman. It was a crime not only against the victim lady rather also against the whole society. The physical suffering and mental trauma caused by this heinous crime are of the similar nature, respective of the fact whether the victim was a married or unmarried woman or a prostitute. A prostitute is also a human being and she possesses all human rights by virtue of being a human being. She has also got, like any other human being, the right to self-dignity, self determination and independent existence. Forcing, therefore, a woman to surrender herself against her wishes for use by some body constituted a ave violation of her right of leading a dignified life and self-determination and it also amounted to an insult to the human right of woman.<br><br>

The Mopted the doctrine of non-discrimination whereby no body shall be apex Court further held that the Nepalese Constitution of 1990 has deprived of equal protection of the laws. Although equality means equality mong the equals, however, depending on the prevailing conditions and The made. Although Article 11 (3) of the Nepalese Constitution has given pumstances sometimes just and reasonable classifications could also the scope for making positive discrimination, nonetheless it has not

316pp




visualized for making negative discrimination. Hence, it is impossible to buy the discriminatory view that our Constitution has made any type of discrimination against prostitute woman. As the Constitution has not made any such discrimination, the discriminatory provisions made by law by classifying women into prostitutes and other women could not be treated as just and reasonable. The legal provision of lesser punishment for rapists of prostitutes tended to downgrade prostitutes, without any just or reasonable basis, to the position of women of lower status and made discriminatory treatment. The belief that there should be variations in punishment to be awarded to the convicts of crime committed against a particular category of people on the basis of their profession or their character would not be held as just or reasonable. The learned judges were also of the opinion that if such a discriminatory legal provision was allowed to continue that would indirectly help encourage the rape of prostitutes.<br><br>

The apex Court further opined that coercion, threat and use of force constituted the core of the crime of rape. The "mens rea" and "actus reus of the criminals were always similar in an act of rape committed on women, irrespective of their class. A legal provision for awarding lesser or greater punishment to criminals on the basis of the character or profession of the victims seemed to be discriminatory in view of the spirit of the Constitution, various International Covenants concerning women and human rights and the recognized principles of justice. Hence, the Special bench, issuing the writ, declared the impugned Section 7 as inconsistent with Article 1 of the present Constitution of Nepal and declared it void under Article 88(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

Act, 2042 (B.S.) was challenged as inconsistent with Articles 11, 12 (e) and 17 of the Constitution of Nepal, the petitioner contended that since the impugned Section 12 stipulated that no employment agency shall provide foreign employment to a woman without prior permission of her concerned guardian as well as of His Majesty's Government it was discriminatory towards women because it imposed unreasonable restrictions on their freedom of practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation. Disposing the writ petition, a Special Bench observed that the legal provision of Section 12 of the Foreign Employment Act, 2042 did not impose any restriction that a woman could never go out on a foreign employment or an authorized agency could never provide a foreign employment to a woman. Rather it simply created a procedural condition while granting foreign employment to a woman. The learned justices held that it was the duty of every Welfare State to provide special protection to the interests of women, children and the aged and our Constitution too was committed to this end by providing scope for making protective discrimination in Article 11(3) of the Constitution. Hence, it was not proper to develop a negative perception of the particular law which had been formulated with an objective of protecting such women, going on foreign employment, against prospective exploitation or fraud in the foreign countries.<br><br>

The Court further held that it was a well-recognized principle of interpretation that in regard to interpretation and application of any law was concerned, it was the latter which took precedence over the former. so far as the question of priority of the central provision and its proviso And, the central provision alone could not be viewed independently and separately. Hence, the central provision of Article 11(3) of the Constitution ught to be viewed in the context of the proviso to that Article which provided for protection of the female class. Thus, since the impugned Act intended to protect the special interests of women by imposing some restrictions on the authorized employment agencies, it was erroneous to treat it as discriminatory on the ground of sex.<br><br>

The apex Court furthermore held that the proviso to Article 12 (2) (e) of the present Constitution of Nepal empowered the State to make laws prescribing conditions for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation. Prescribing such condition could not be deemed as imposing restrictions on the enjoyment of the fundamental freedom guaranteed by Article 12(e) of the Constitution. Likewise, the Right to property guaranteed by Article 17 (1) was available to the Nepalese citizens subject to the existing law. The procedural requirement imposed on an authorized foreign employment agency did not make any discriminatory treatment to women in regard to their right to acquire, own, sell or otherwise dispose of property. Hence, the apex Court unanimously rejected the writ petition. In view of the socio-economic conditions of a developing country like Nepal and the lower level of literacy, particularly female literacy, this decision of the Court is indicative of the fact that our apex Judiciary is guided by the ground reality of the Nepalese society and is pragmatist and realistic in its approach. The Judiciary did well not to allow itself to be swept off by the modern sweeping currents of neo-feminism which sometimes, in it's over zealousness, seems to threaten the interests of women themselves.<br><br>

The case of Tara Devi Poudyal v, the Cabinet Secretariat & Others) is something an indicator of the cautious hesitation of the Supreme Court of Nepalese society. In this case, the petitioner had challenged the Nepal not to disturb the social and cultural values prevailing in the Constitutionality of Section 4 of the chapter on Incestuous Sex of the Country Code as being inconsistent with Articles 11(1) (2) and (3) of the Constitution of Nepal. The petitioner, the widow of a soldier in the Indian Army, claimed that she had married the younger brother of her dead husband in order to be eligible to claim the family pension under the Indian Army Pension Regulation Act, 1961 which provided that in the event of the death of a soldier if his widow got married to his younger

Supreme Court Bulletin No. 20, Vol. 230, at 1:

brother she would be entitled to the family pension. She was being tried for incestuous marriage under a plaint filed by someone who was not an heir-copartner. The petitioner contended that since there was no legal prohibition on the marriage of a widower with the sister of his deceased wife, the penal provision of Section 4 of the chapter On Incestuous Sex was discriminatory between men and women.<br><br>

Disposing the writ petition, a five member Special bench presided by the then Chief Justice Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya observed that since the sister of a deceased wife was not a member of the family of the husband nor was she agnostic to him, it was not proper to treat a widower and a widow as being on the same footing in this regard. The Right to equality means the equal application of law among the equals and not equal application and equal protection of the law among the unequal.<br><br>

The Court further observed that a study of the Preamble to the Country Code ("Muluki Ain") revealed that some of its provisions had been influenced by the Hindu Dharmshastras. So as Article 19 of the Constitution granted every person freedom to profess and practise his own religion as handed down to him from ancient times, having due regard to traditional practices, Section 10 (A) of the chapter On Incestuous Sex permitted incestuous sexual relation or marriage between relations whose caste or racial practices had permitted such incestuous intercourse. But the purpose of the prohibiting provision of the impugned Section 4 of the chapter On Incestuous Sex was to control adultery in the society and, therefore, it was not deemed proper to interfere with the wisdom of the Legislature in regard to such matters. The learned judges further opined that under the Nepalese legal system after the death of a husband his Assets and liabilities succeed to his widow who becomes a copartner in the love her chastity her relation with her dead husband remained as such. Thus, since while her relation with her dead husband continued to be the family property. So long as she remained true to her husband and did not same as it was before, it was not lawful to say that her previous relationship of sister-in-law with the younger brother of her deceased

husband did not continue to exist. The apex Court, therefore, ruled that the impugned Section 4 did not seem to impose any unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right of the petitioner and thus it was not discriminatory. This unanimous decision of the Supreme Court may be laudable from a traditional Hindu viewpoint. But strong reservations can be put forward in regard to the appropriateness and suitability of the conservative value inherent in the ratio of the decision. In the modern times, the social reformers have been strongly advocating for eradication of the social evil of forcing a widow, even though she was young, not to get remarried. It is high time the willing widows were allowed to get married even to the brothers of their deceased husbands. Such a practice may also help further reintegration of the exiting family bond.<br><br>

In Kamanand Ram and Others v. HMG and Others 762, the petitioners alleged that the defendants who were legally obligated to carry out the obligations of the State did not undertake their duties of providing administrative support and initiatives in eradicating untouchability and discouraging such malpractices in light with the Constitution and CERD. The petitioners who belonged to the Dalit community of Siraha and Saptari districts were allegedly forced by the people belonging to the upper class of Hindus to do the menial service of disposing corpses (dead bodies) of animals. On their refusal to oblige they were subjected to social and financial boycott and segregation. Disposing the writ petition, a Division bench beld that in view of the Constitutional commitment towards eradication of comprising justices Krishna Jung Raymajhi and Kedar Prasad Giri the malpractice of untouchability and discrimination on the ground of Caste it was not appropriate for Government offices like District Administration Office and District Police Office and local bodies like District Development Committees, Municipalities and Village Development Committees to display apathy and negligence in carrying out their legal obligations. Those offices and institutions were duty bound to work

towards eradication of untouchability and discrimination as enjoined by Section 10 A of the chapter on Adal in the National Code of Nepal. The apex Court issued a directive order to the defendants instructing them to always remain active and alert in carrying out their legal obligation in this regard.<br><br>

In Krishna Prasad Shiwakoti V. HMG and Others763, the petitioner alleged that Section 10 of the chapter on Adal contravened the Constitutional provision of the right against discrimination guaranteed by Article 11(4) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal and prayed the apex Court to declare it ultra vires' of the Constitution. The petitioner also prayed it to issue a writ of mandamus to the defendants to make a law for the upliftment, protection and welfare of the Dalit community as well as another penal law for awarding punishment to the perpetrators of discrimination on the basis of caste.<br><br>

A Special Bench observed that Section 10 of the chapter on Adal provided that no one shall do or get done any work by misleading or coercing others, thereby disturbing or damaging the social customs and practices of others. This legal provision simply prevented the act of disturbing social Customs and practices. This provision seemed to be guided by the principle of not adversely affecting the rights and freedoms of others while exercising one's own rights. Articles 18 and 19 of the Constitution, had so granted every person and denomination the right of protecting and promoting their culture, religion and tradition. The interference in the customs and practices of others could not be acceptable. The Special bench, therefore, opined that the impugned Section 10 did not contravene the right against discrimination embodied in Article 11(4) of the Constitution

So far as the second question of making laws in accordance with Article 11(3) and (4) was concerned, the apex Court held that the Constitution had entrusted that responsibility to the Executive and the Legislature which could make protective legislation for the protection and promotion of the interests of women, children, the aged, the physically or mentally incapacitated persons or socially or educationally depressed classes or people. The Court opined that it shall be, therefore, neither appropriate nor Constitutional to issue instructions to make a special type of law in a situation where such a law was yet to be enacted.<br><br>

Similarly, in Durga Sob V. HMG and Others, dealing with almost an identical issue relating to the alleged unconstitutionality of Section 10 of the chapter on Adal and the demand for framing of a special law relating to the creation of a National Commission for the Dalits, a Special Bench reaffirmed the principles initiated earlier in the preceding case of Krishna Prasad Shiwakoti, and dismissed the plea of the petitioner that the impugned Section 10 was unconstitutional. The learned justices, as in the earlier quoted case, refused to interfere in the functioning of other organs of the State by dictating the Legislature to enact a particular type of law. The apex Court also held that it was the right and obligation of His Majesty's Government to decide whether there was a need for setting up a Commission for the protection of the interests of the Dalit community. However, the apex Court preferred to issue a directive to His Majesty's Government to remain constantly vigilant and active towards discharging its duty of directing its responsible organs to undertake their duties and obligations enjoined by the laws framed under the Right to equality. It is inexplicable why the Special bench expressed its limitation in these two cases in regard to issuing instruction to His Majesty's Government for framing a particular type of law to address the malady of discrimination in several other cases, such as, Meera Dhungana v. HMG & Others (1995). Chanda Bajracharya v. HMG & Others (1996), Lok Bhakta Rana v. Rama

Devi Rajbhandari & Others (1998) etc, the apex Court had very liberally issued directives to His Majesty's Government to take initiatives to enact particular types of law and present them for the consideration of Parliament. This sort of inconsistent logic and approach can be hardly justified and may also run the risk of being confronted with the charge of expediency and convenience.<br><br>

In Advocate Chandra Kant Gyawali & Others v. HMG and Others's a Special Bench delivered a landmark judgment-invalidating clause (1) of rule 21 of the Prison Rules, 1963 as violative of the equality clause (Art 11(3)) of the Constitution. This rule had provided for classifying prisoners in class A and class B on the basis of their level of education and social and economic status. There was greater difference in respect of daily allowances and other facilities to be provided to the prisoners belonging to class A and class B. The learned justices rightly observed that as the law does not determine the quantum of punishment on the basis of the level of education of the accused rather on the basis of the gravity of the offence so also the convicts should not be classified into different groups on ulterior considerations, like their level of education and status. Every person condemned to punishment according to the nature of the crime committed by him must be made to undergo the punishment in the similar manner. Higher education or higher living standard of a convict could not be a valid factor to detract from the punishment handed out to him. The learned judges further observed that our Constitution did not permit such waiver, relaxation or Special privilege to the people belonging to higher social status. It would tend to be discriminatory to differentiate between the people solely on the grounds of higher or lower status and also contrary to the spirit of the Constitution guided by the objective of the creation for an egalitarian society. Hence, the Apex Court unanimously held the impugned provision contained in clause (1) of rule 21 of the Prison Rules, 1963 as repugnant to Article 11(3) of the Constitution and

rendered it derecognized and ineffective in view of the provision of Article 131 of the Constitution. However, it is highly regrettable that although this decision had been made on June 3, 2000, the alleged discriminatory treatment is still being generally carried out in practice in various prisons. The failure of the Executive in regard to the implementation of this verdict of the Apex Court has caused surprise among the legal practitioners. Consequently, the petitioners are reported to be contemplating to sue the Executive for committing contempt of Court on this count.766<br><br>

In Ishwari Prasad Sangraula V. the Britain Nepal Medical Trust77, the Supreme Court held that no right (including the Right to Equality) could be created by resorting to the means of a prerogative writ. On the contrary it is only a right already established under law that could be enforced by the means of writ. The petitioner who had been hired by the respondent BNMT as a training coordinator for a fixed period of three years on a monthly salary of Rs. 24,000/- had subsequently sued the BNMT for discriminating against him in respect of remuneration as compared to other foreigner trainers who were paid higher salaries. Dismissing the writ petition, the Division Bench presided by Justice Bhairav Prasad Lamsal held that since the petitioner had entered into the service of the Trust by willingly accepting the terms and conditions of the contract he had no legal ground to claim that he had been subjected to inequality and discrimination in respect of monthly remuneration as compared to his foreign counterparts employed by the Trust.<br><br>

Keshav Khadka v. Dhankuta District Court & Others768 a Division Bench held the detention of a minor, Keshav Khadka, in prison, as illegal, and directed the concerned authorities of His Majesty's Government to make necessary arrangements for his stay in some Child Reform House (Brutal). Section 15 of the Act Relating to Children, 1991 provides that a minor sentenced to imprisonment must not be placed in the prison along with adult prisoners. Rather such a minor must be kept separately in Child Reform House as required by Section 42 of the Act. so long as such a Child Reform House was not set up, minors may be temporarily entrusted to the care of child Welfare Centres, orphanages or the like, privately run by other people. This very principle had been earlier affirmed by a Division Bench in Aashih Adhikari in favour of Bablu Godiya v. Banke District Court & Others 769<br><br>

In Mithilesh Kumar Singh & Another u. the Prime Minister & Others the petitioners challenged the Constitutionality of Section 5(2) of the Labour Act, 1991 and bye-laws 3(1) and 39(1) of the Labour Rules, 1993 as violative of Article 20(2) of the Constitution of 1990 which guaranteed against the employment of any minor in any factory or mine or this engagement in any other hazardous work. A Special Bench held that the Constitution did not define the term minor but Section 2 of the Labour Act, 1991, defined minor as a person who had attained the age of 15 but not crossed the age of 18. Section 17 of that Act prohibited the engagement of of a minor having crossed 14 years of age who could be engaged in certain a minor below the age of 14 as a laborer but relaxed the provision in case conditions as a laborer except between the period of 6 p.m. to 6 am and not against his wishes. Hence, the learned judges held that the impugned laws were not violative of the spirit of the Right against Exploitation as Baranteed by Article 20 of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Tarak Dhital & Others v. Chief District Administrator of Kathmandu & Other the Supreme Court displayed its concern and sensitivity towards exploitation and torture meted out to minors and the infringement of their rights embodied in the Minors Act, 1991. It is worth recalling that a few years back the national dailies caused a shocking sensation by headlining the revealing news of the exploitation of a twelve year old child named Dheeraj K.C. who had been forcibly kept as a domestic servant by one Madhusudan Nakarmi who used to keep the poor child all fettered in chains and locked him inside his apartment when he used to be out to attend his office. The Court directed Kathmandu District Court to re register the case kept dormant quite for some time and to give priority in disposal of that case.<br><br>

In Chandra Nath Sapkota v. Home Ministry & Others?", the petitioner alleged that the defendant Home Ministry had cancelled the registration of Child Awareness Group in contravention of Article 12 (2)(c) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal and Article 15 (1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. Disposing the writ petition, a Division Bench observed that a citizen's freedom to form union and association guaranteed by Article 12 (2) (c) of the Constitution could be reasonably restricted only under laws made under provisos to that Article. Nonetheless, the State could not impose restrictions on such a freedom without making a law to that effect. The freedom of forming unions or associations was available to every Nepali citizen. And the word "citizen mentioned in Article 12 (2) did not discriminate between a minor boy or a minor girl nor did it deprive a minor of his/her right to form a union or State to make special protective provisions for the protection and Association. Whereas Article 11(3) of the Constitution had enjoined on the development of children, it was not at all proper to cancel the registration of the above mentioned Child Awareness Group, which had been already Met up by the children themselves and even renewed for the promotion of

the interests and welfare of children, only because its membership comprised of minors. Besides, also because Article 15 (1) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989 had also enjoined on the State parties to recognize the rights of the child to freedom of association, it was held that the State could not infringe such a right of the minors. The ruling in this case is a laudable continuation of the sensitivity and concern displayed by our Supreme Court in several cases in the preceding years for the protection and promotion of the interests of children.<br><br>

6.3.1.3 Right to Personal Liberty & Right against Preventive Detention<br><br>

Article 12 of the present Constitution of Nepal has guaranteed against the deprivation of one's personal liberty save in accordance with law. Corresponding to Article 12, Article 15 embodies the Right against Preventive Detention. This Article stipulates that nobody can be held arbitrarily in detention unless there is a sufficient ground or existence of an immediate threat to the sovereignty, integrity or law and order situation of the Kingdom of Nepal.<br><br>

Ever since the promulgation of the Nepalese Constitution of 1990, the Supreme Court has consistently affirmed in several cases relating to preventive detention that there must be obvious and logical connection between the object for putting someone in detention and the reason and ground for such a detention. If the need for putting in preventive detention does not seem to exist objectively, the detention becomes vitiated and unlawful. Living to its recent judicial tradition of enquiring about whether or not there is apparent existence of sufficient and reasonable prima facie ground for preventive detention, the Apex Court, in the preceding year. Wanted relief to several aggrieved persons by ordering their release from egal detention. In Kalpana Subedi v. HMG and Others??, Umesh Kumar Sah v. HMG and Others?73, and Hasta Bahadur BK v. HMG and Others?<br><br>

Supreme Court Bulletin, Vol. 218, at 10 (2058). Supreme Court Bulletin, Vol.208, at 2 (2056).

the Supreme Court held that so long as there were not sufficient grounds to prove as to which acts of the detainee caused immediate threat to the sovereignty, integrity or law and order situation of the Kingdom of Nepal, he could not be deprived of his precious personal liberty. For the lack of sufficient grounds the Apex Court held those detentions as illegal and violative of Art. 12(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

But when such sufficient grounds were presented to the satisfaction of the Apex Court, the detention had been held lawful. For example, in Shanti Prajuli v. HMG & Others?75, a Division Bench held that since the detainee had confessed before the Police that, under the directions of her husband who was an underground Maoist activist, she had been actively involved in the Maoist activities directed against the present political system and also because she had been caught red-handed wearing Maoist uniform and possessing some banners containing Maoist slogans, her preventive detention by the chief District Officer under Section 3.1 of the Public Security Act, 1989 could not be held as unjustified and without sufficient grounds.<br><br>

Similarly, in Rameshwar Chaulagai & Others V. District Administration Office of Sindhupalchowk,776 a Division Bench of the Apex Court declared the detention of the petitioner as illegal because, although charged with an offence under the Arms and Ammunition Act, 1962 punishable with a maximum imprisonment of two years and a fine up to Rs. 1,200/-, he had been kept in judicial custody pending trial of his case, for more than two years and four months obviously a period longer than the one prescribed by the law even in case of his possible conviction.<br><br>

6.3.1.4 Protection and Promotion of the Freedom of Information<br><br>

Article 16 of the Constitution of 1990 guarantees every citizen the right freedom to demand and receive information on any matter of public importance. In several cases decided in the past the Supreme Court of Nepal has protected and enforced a citizen's Right to Information. But in Jhank Kadel v. PM Girija Prasad Koirala & Others777 the right to demand and receive information on any matter of public importance was negated by the Supreme Court on the plea that Article 31 prevailed over Article 16 in so far as any act related with His Majesty the King was concerned. This case arose out of a controversy relating to an order of the Registrar of the Supreme Court refusing to grant permission to register a petition seeking information about the property of late His Majesty King Birendra. The Single Bench of the Apex Court presided by Justice Meen Bahadur Raymajhi outright rejecting the writ petition, held that the details and whereabouts of the personal property of late King Birendra were matters directly related to His Majesty the King and the Royal Family, and His Majesty the King had the authority to perform any act in that regard. Hence, as per Art. 31 of the Constitution no question shall be raised in any Court about any act performed by His Majesty, no writ petition could be entertained in regard to such a demand. As is obvious from the decision, the Apex Court preferred to reject the writ petition purely on a technical ground by allowing Article 31 to prevail over Article 16 of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Gopal Siwakoti and Others v. HMG, Ministry of Finance and Others, popularly known to as the Arun III Case, the Supreme Court analyzed the whole scenario of the Nepalese law regarding the right to information. It also developed the right to information law until Parliament enacts a separate right to information legislation. This case provides the guideline to operate right to information issues in the realm. This case proves that the role of the judiciary is unparalleled in ensuring the right to

330pp



information to make it meaningful in tune with the Constitution. The Court, in this case, filled the gap, which existed in Nepalese legislation as to people's right to information.<br><br>

In this case the petitioner, a human rights activist demanded the information regarding Arun III project from the Ministry of Water Resources. The Ministry did not provide him the information he had sought. After such a denial the petitioner filed public interest litigation against the Minister of Water Resources and others invoking Article 16 of the Constitution. The Court observed that most of the official documents of the public offices do not come into public light through publication so that Article 16 of the Constitution came to provide access on such documents. The Supreme Court cited the Constitution Recommendation Commission to support its findings. The Explanatory Memorandum on Article 16 of the Constitution inter alia states that openness is the basic feature of democratic society. People should have the right to know in order to enable them to perform regular supervision of the government and to oversee whether it is clean and targeted in right direction.<br><br>

In this case the Supreme Court also relied on the experience of other countries. The Court cited American Freedom of Information Act 1966, Australian Freedom of Information Act 1982 and Section 76 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 delivering its judgment. Similarly, the Court also examined the provisions of prevailing Nepalese laws that authorize to get a copy of official documents and found that under such laws only the concerned party is entitled to ask for a copy. He has to pay the prescribed fee and show the reasons why he needs the requested document. If the official document is unpublished confidential one, it may be available subject to the permission of the departmental head. If the departmental head denies giving such document there is no way out against such denial. No departmental head or office in-charge is under obligation to furnish unpublished secret documents.779 The Court found the provisions

The Chapter on Court Procedure Section 211 and The Chapter on the Examination of Papers Section 17 of the National Code 1963. (The National Code is the main source of

of the Nepalese law not supportive to the petitioner in obtaining the requested documents.<br><br>

The Court in this case even examined the provisions of the Secrecy of Documents Act 1982 (though the Act was not in forced) to support its reasoning. It took help of that enactment which states that no documents other than the classified documents under Sections 5, 6 and 7 shall be treated as secret-780<br><br>

The Court did not find Nepalese legislation to provide adequate remedy for the petitioner and therefore took help of the Article 16 of the Constitution to reach a conclusion. It found contradiction between legislation and the spirit of the Article 16 of the Constitution and held that, on the one hand, people's right to information is already established, on the other hand there is no clear provision of law about what, how much and which procedure is applicable to get such information. This situation of confusion and gap requires to be filled up 781<br><br>

Justifying the statement so made, the Court held that a right without a remedy is meaningless. In order to make such a right real and effective thereby making it a living right, remedy is inevitable. Remedy cannot be given as such without procedural means. Hence, in absence of any guidelines logical procedures should follow. Based on different methods the Court issued eight points guideline to HMG to follow and provide remedy therein. The guidelines are as follows782:<br><br>

1. The petitioner may demand from the respondent the list of available documents on the topics on which he wants to have information;<br><br>

2. If the demanded list is supplied by the respondent within seven days of such a demand the petitioner may ask for an opportunity of perusal of the documents with which he is concemed;<br><br>

332pp



3. If there is any demand in pursuance of guidelines above, the respondent should notify the petitioner of the time, date and place to inspect the documents within three days.<br><br>

4. After perusal inspection of the documents the petitioner may note down necessary information or copy them all if he so wishes, and if duplicate copies are needed, he should request to the authorized official for certified duplicate copies as requested;<br><br>

5. If there is no rule applicable for the purpose of making duplicates available to the petitioner, certified copies of the document should be made available charging the actual costs involved as the service fee;<br><br>

6. If there are situations due to which the respondent does not want to give the list of the concerned documents in part or full, he should inform the petitioner within three days of the reasons for it;<br><br>

7. If the petitioner is not satisfied with the notification of rejection on the grounds for it, he should make complaint to the Supreme Court within 7 days of such a notice for the judicial resolution of the controversy;<br><br>

8. The judicial procedures to be applied in the complaint shall be as set out in the Supreme Court rules.<br><br>

The guidelines were not confined to the case. They are at par with the Nepalese law until the government passes an appropriate law to this ellect 783<br><br>

The Court in this case also reiterated its earlier stance as to the information in matter of public importance and observed that784: The Court can consider a case under Article 88(2) of the Constitution if it is related with security of the realm, law and order, education, health, morality, economic conditions of the country, development of water resources and social justice as enumerated in the directive principles of

dat 278, para 41. dat 271-272.1 para 25:

333pp


the state policies. These are matters of public interest and thus, matters of public importance.

Similarly, the Court viewed Article 16 as the background right of Article 12(2)(a) of the Constitution which guarantees the right to freedom of opinion and expression. It is submitted that the right to information is a wider right and is not limited as the background right to the freedom of opinion and expression. However, in the context of this case the approach of the Court need not further comment.<br><br>

Even though the respondents in their written statement stated that a wide range of information related to Arun III project is disseminated through the press conference and gatherings and even they are ready to provide information to the petitioner if he specifically mentions the information. The Court did not agree with this contention of the respondents. It found that there was no meeting of mind between the petitioner and the respondents regarding the requested information. The respondents did not even submit any documents except the memorandum of understanding. During the hearing the lawyers of the respondents submitted that it is difficult to provide the maps and designs of the project. Given the situation, the Court issued an order of mandamus against the respondents, Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Water Resources, to perform the function as per the guidelines developed in this case.<br><br>

The Arun III case is the backdrop of the right to information. It did not only establish a precedent for the procedure to obtain official documents. It also established precedent regarding locus standi in the right to information cases. Moreover, it provided public interest nexus in right to information. As to public interest, the Court held that If HMG or any public body or official thereof fails to fulfill his official duties or commits any wrong which is detrimental to the interest or right of the ordinary people, it becomes a matter of public interest. In addition, we cannot draw

a boundary of subject matter as to what constitutes public interest. The Court also stated that every public interest dispute could not be judicially settled. It can be judicially settled only if the matter in question

is of public interest and involves a question that needs an interpretation of law or the Constitution.<br><br>

The Court considered Arun III Project, as a project having public's concern from the observation of enclosed materials in the file because the project seems to be launched with national and international resources and means to develop hydro-electricity in the country. In such a subject matter having public interest the petitioner has right to demand and receive information. Explaining its relevance with the right to information, the Court agreed with the contention of the petitioner regarding locus standi in such matter.<br><br>

6.3.1.5 Right to Fresh Environment and Protection of Archaeological Goods<br><br>

In Kashi Dahal v. HMG. Secretariat of the Council of Ministers and others, popularly known to as the Lumbini Case, the petitioner had prayed the Supreme Court under its extraordinary jurisdiction to issue an order to provide information relating to why the decision to chop down the sacred Pipal tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha at Lumbini was taken in addition to translocation of the temple of Mayadevi. The petitioner had contended that the sacred Pipal tree and Mayadevi temple are important national heritage and destruction of or tampering with these historic resources is tantamount to doing an annihilation of the historic and culturally sensitive assets.<br><br>

In this case, the petitioner approached the Court on the basis of news published by two weekly newspapers called "The Rastrapukar" and "The Nepal Jagaran" that published news about the chopping down of the pipal tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha. These newspapers raised the issue that the stem and branches of the chopped down pipal tree were being smuggled in the name of Lord Buddha and an enormous amount of money had been illegally collected by the authority of Lumbini Development Fund.<br><br>

335pp




In the written statement filed by the respondents in the Supreme Court it was stated that the respondents informed the public regarding such activities from time to time. However, the respondents could not produce any evidence to support this contention. So, the Court did not agree with the plea of the respondents and ordered the respondents to divulge publicly the reasons why the sacred pipal tree needed to be chopped down and idols of Mayadevi temple to be shifted from there. Krishna Jung Rayamajhi, J. held that it was the duty of the agencies concerned to immediately execute flow of information to public in general on the matter of archaeological, religious and historic interests. Not doing this amounts to failing in their duties.<br><br>

The Supreme Court in this case changed its earlier modus operandi to provide requested information. In this case the Court ordered the respondent to disseminate information to the public by mass media instead of giving it to the petitioner alone. The decision of this case overturns some of the earlier rulings. It also established a precedent that the subject matter, which was of historic, religious and archaeological significance is a matter of public importance.<br><br>

In Amar Bahadur Shrestha as notification issued by HMG for restricting cutting down, transportation and foreign export of certain trees including khayer was questioned. In the case Rule 12 and 13 of the Forest Rules, 2051 those authorize HMG to restrict for harvesting and collection etc. of certain forest products by publishing notification in the Nepal Gazette were challenged. The petitioner has further argued that these provisions do not apply in the case of private forest .The Supreme Court ruled that it cannot be presumed a provision of law contrary to the Constitution merely on the ground that the petitioner has contended it as against rights and interests. It further said the petitioner has not contended that the

Rules are not made to fulfill the objectives of the Act. Section 70A of the Forest Act has authorized to restrict harvesting and consumption etc. of certain forest products. Thus these provisions cannot be said contrary to the Constitutional provisions. In this case the Court did not proceed further to test whether the government has authority to restrict the property right of the individuals and the present case falls or not within this limitation.<br><br>

6.3.1.6 Right to Property<br><br>

Article 17 of the Constitution guaranteeing the Right to Property has got three facets. Clause (1) guarantees, every citizen, to have, subject to the existing laws, the right to acquire, own, sell and otherwise dispose of property. Clause (2) forbids the State to, except in the public interest, requisition, acquire or create any encumbrance on the property of any person. And clause (3) provides for enacting law to prescribe the basis of compensation and procedure for giving compensation for any property requisitioned, acquired or encumbered by the State in the public interest.<br><br>

During the period under survey a few significant decisions have been made by the Apex Court concerning the Right to Property. In Lalit Bahadur Khatri V HMG & Others76 the Supreme Court granted relief to the petitioner whose landed property had been held in possession by His Majesty's Government for a considerable period of time without completing the other necessary formalities required by the law. In order to set up entertainment plaza at four places around the Ring Road the Works and Transport Ministry of His Majesty's Government had published a notification some 21 years back under Section 7(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1961 to acquire some land including that of the petitioner. But thereafter His Majesty's Government did not care to proceed further to the concerned owners as stipulated by Section 12 of the Act. This showed that the act of acquisition had not been performed by completing all the provide compensation or another land in return for the land so acquired to requirements stipulated by the law. The Division Bench held that so long

as the legal procedures were not complied with in accordance with the law, the private property of a citizen could not be treated as lawfully acquired by the State in the public interest. So, the Apex Court issued a writ of mandamus directing the concerned Ministry to vacate the lawful possession of disputed land of the petitioner. This decision appears to be an instance of vindication of a citizen's Right to Property by the Apex Judiciary.<br><br>

But in Binod Prasad Mainali & Others V. HMG & Others77 a Special Bench dismissed a writ petition seeking relief of due compensation for the land of the petitioners on which some sort of encumbrance had been created by the State. In this case the Nepal Electricity Authority and its High Voltage Consolidation Project had restrained the petitioners, under the authority granted by Section 33(3) of the Electricity Act, 1992, from undertaking any construction work or planting any tree within 9 meters on each side of the middle line over which the electric voltage wire was to pass through. Since, the concerned authorities had refused to pay any compensation and intended to pay only 10% damage for such land, the petitioners pleaded that their land could not be acquired in public interest without giving them due compensation as guaranteed by Art. 17(3) of the Constitution. But the learned judges held that such an act of the respondents did not amount to acquisition of the disputed land of the petitioners as they were at liberty to undertake general cultivation on the land. Also, since their ownership remained unaffected and they had been allowed damage to the tune of 10% there was no legal substance in the plea of the petitioners. However, awarding damage to the tune of a meager 10% for creating encumbrance on a precious piece of land, which was meant for use for residential purpose in a metropolitan city like Kathmandu could be hardly justified. Still the Apex Court could not display proper sensitively to appreciate the proportion of damage suffered by the petitioners.<br><br>

6.3.1.6.1. The Furor Caused by PM Deuba's Announcement<br><br>

In a bid to introduce a revolutionary Land Reforms Program an announcement made by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on Shrawan 32, 2058 (August 16, 2001) in the House of Representatives, suspending sale or purchase, transfer or any kind of transaction of immovable property throughout the kingdom of Nepal with immediate effect, generated much heat and fury all over the country. It resulted in the filing of half a dozen writ petitions in the Supreme Court challenging the announcement of the Prime Minister not only as arbitrary and autocratic but also as violative of the Right to Property guaranteed by Article 17 of the Constitution of Nepal. When the Supreme Court refused to grant Interim order staying the operation of the controversial decision of His Majesty's Government and relevant circulars and notification to the effect, it raised eyebrows of a good many intellectuals as well as the legal fraternity. So, much so that the Apex Court was even charged by a considerable number of intelligentsia with failure in its duty of protecting the Constitution and the system of Rule of Law as envisaged by the Constitution. Besides, the Apex Court was also criticized for not showing due seriousness and sensitivity in promptly disposing such a sensitive case engaging the attention of the nation as a whole. In fact, when the much awaited decision was not delivered on September 13, the day scheduled for delivery of the judgment and was postponed for a week, some legal practitioners assembled in the Court room presided by Chief Justice Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya even raised slogans in front of the bench itself dubbing the act of postponement as justice delayed, denied. Advocate Awadesh Kumar Singh as reported by the Kantipur daily of September 14, went to the extent of charging the Supreme Court with unnecessarily prolonging the decision making process under the influence of

the Executive and virtually trembling its feet to deliver the judgment. However, the Apex Court effectively dispelled the public misgivings when only after a week it delivered its landmark judgment enforcing the infringed fundamental right of the people.<br><br>

A five-judge Special Bench in Surendra Mahato & Another v PM Sher Bahadur Deuba & Others, observed that in order to achieve the national objective of equitable distribution of economic gains on the basis of social justice as enjoined by Article 25(2) and to create conditions for economic progress of the peasants by launching Land Reform Program as enjoined by Article 26(5) of the Constitution His Majesty's Government was well within its right to make necessary policy decisions and to act accordingly. Such policy decisions might not be a subject of judicial review. Nonetheless if those policy decisions seemed to infringe any prevalent Constitutional and legal provisions they shall fall within the purview of judicial review. As the preamble of the present Nepalese Constitution has assimilated and accepted the principle of Constitutional supremacy and the Rule of Law everybody is required to act within the parameters of the Constitution and the laws. The Apex Court, thus, ruled that, in contravention of the Right to Property guaranteed by Art. 17(1) of the Constitution, His Majesty's Government had no authority to impose restrictions on the citizens' exercise of the Right to Property on the basis of a policy decision made by it. With all due respect to the Supreme Court it must, however, be submitted that although this rather belated decision did a lot to salvage the injured reputation of the Apex Judiciary, the Supreme Court should have better cared not to have allowed the things to come to such a sorry pass.<br><br>

Article 17 of the Constitution guaranteeing the Right to Property has got three facets. Clause (1) guarantees, every citizen, to have, subject to the existing laws, the right to acquire, own, sell and otherwise dispose of property, Clause (2) forbids the State to, except in the public interest, requisition, acquire or create any encumbrance on the property of any person. And clause (3) provides for enacting law to prescribe the basis of Compensation and procedure for giving compensation for any property The supreme Court, in light of Art. 17 of the Constitution has made a requisitioned, acquired or encumbered by the State in the public interest.

In Mithilesh Kumar789 the Land (Fourth Amendment) Act, 2053 was challenged on the ground that it violated the Fundamental Right to Property under Article 17 of the Constitution. The impugned Act provided equal share to landlord and tenant in the tenancy land. Prior to the amendment landlord owed three fourth shares and tenant owed one fourth share. The Court held the impugned amendment Constitutional.<br><br>

The decision of the Supreme Court in this case is landmark in various respects. The Court held right to be a Fundamental or Constitutional the prevailing Article must have created such right. Article 17(1) has not created any right within itself. It only guarantees the rights created by other laws and in absence of Article 17(1) also the right to property granted by the laws can be enjoyed. The Court further held the heading of an Article does not limit the content of the article. And the right granted by Article 17(1) is not a fundamental one. Under Article 17(2) and (3) right to get compensation may be said as right.<br><br>

The Court did not proceed further to examine the test of reasonableness of law regulating property rights. It found the law was made to uplift the life standard of the tenant class, to increase the productivity of the land leading to just distribution of national property and social justice directed by the Directive Principles of the State under Article 25 and State Policies under Article 26. It seems from the holding of the Court that the Directive Principles of the State Policies have priority over the Fundamental Rights. The decision clears the way for law providing for egalitarian and agrarian reforms. The legislature has comfortable way to initiate reform through law. There was a great tussle in Indian Constitutional history between the legislature and the judiciary over the subject of land reform law and Mithilesh Kumar Singh v. Prime Minister et. al.

In Murari Prasad Aryal there was a challenge of Constitutionality of section 13 (1) of the Bonus Act, 2030 (this sub-section is inserted by the fourth amendment) that provided that where there is excess amount of money, after distributing the required amount of bonus to the concerned workers, from the amount set aside for distribution of bonus at the rate of ten percent of net profit of an enterprise, seventy percent of the remaining amount shall be deposited in enterprise level welfare fund and the remaining thirty percent amount shall be deposited in national level welfare fund. The petitioner claimed that they do not manage the national level fund and it is inconsistency with fundamental right to property to take away the thirty- percent of remaining amount, which is earned through his hard labor. The Court found that the amount deposited in national level welfare fund might also be used for the benefit of the workers including the petitioner. On the other hand the Court ruled that there is no right created in favor of the workers in the excess amount nor, the amount after distributing the maximum limit of distributable amount, does reduce maximum amount of bonus receivable by the petitioners. Thus, there is no unreasonable restriction on the right to property guaranteed under Article 17 of the Constitution.<br><br>

Act, 1961 to acquire some land including that of the petitioner. But thereafter His Majesty's Government did not care to proceed further to provide compensation or another land in return for the land so acquired to the concerned owners as stipulated by Section 12 of the Act. This showed that the act of acquisition had not been performed by completing all the requirements stipulated by the law. Justice Laxman Prasad Aryal, speaking on behalf of the Division Bench, held that so long as the legal procedures were not complied with in accordance with the law, the private property of a citizen could not be treated as lawfully acquired by the State in the public interest. So, the Apex Court issued a writ of mandamus directing the concerned Ministry to vacate the lawful possession of disputed land of the petitioner.

6.3.1.7 Judicial Review on Treaty Law

The international treaties of which Nepal is a party are law in Nepal. In case of inconsistency of provisions of treaty and law in force the treaty provisions have superseding effect.793 But in Nepalese legal system there in no case law that has held provision of Nepal law applicable in case of inconsistency with a treaty provision. In a number of cases the legal provisions are challenged as contrary to the provision of internal human right conventions especially relating to rights of women794 as well as to the Constitutional provisos. In these cases the Court has made referential citation and discussion of such international instruments was there but no case has been decided only on the ground of testing on treaty provision. These cases were decided on the basis of Constitutional provisions. In Mira Dhungana the Supreme Court didn't hold a legal provision ineffective because of being inconsistent with international conventions. But the Court indirectly applied the provisions through liberal interpretation (perhaps very difficult to be convinced to whether it is interpretation only) of legal provision.<br><br>

Section WI) of the Nepal Treaties Act reads Where there is inconsistency af prison of fcution of or approval of or accession to is done by the Parlament, with any proves of of which His Majesty's Goverment or the Kingdom of Supil is a party after as force the protaion of the treaty shall prevail<br><br>

The petitioners had claimed that the provision has discriminated among married and unmarried women on the ground that the same act is considered as crime when committed against an unmarried woman and not a crime when committed against a married woman by her husband. The Court held rape is a heinous crime and where marital rape is not given special and clear immunity, no 1 of Chapter of Rape of the Muluki Ain requires interpretation in the context of international law that is in the form of international treaties and legal principles. Then the Court seek help of provisions of two international conventions to interpret the provision- Article 1 of CEDAW has defined discrimination against women in the sense that the differential treatment of women on the basis of their marital status also discrimination. Article 2 of the United Nations Declaration on Elimination of Violence against Women (General Assembly Resolution no. 48/104) inter alia includes rape committed within marital relation as violence against women.<br><br>

Superiority of the treaty provisions was upheld by the Court stating Section 9 of the Treaty Act, 2047 has made clear that the referred international treaties are to be accepted as law. The position of the treaties of which Nepal is a party is superior because in case of inconsistency between the treaties and Nepal law the provisions of the treaties prevail. While constructing the meaning of rape the provisions of the treaties and spirit of the Constitution should be kept in mind.<br><br>

Then the Court interpreted the provision satiating, from the point of view of literal interpretation of law no 1 of the chapter of Rape of Muluki Ain also has excluded the rape committed against owns wife. The exception cause must be clear and unambiguous. Sahdswa795 wife of other used in the said section is not used in the sense of excluding owns wife. That is used only in the sense of an adjective. There is no general rule first and This word is an adjective used before a woman who is married and her husband is still

345pp



exception after the general rule to exclude the rape committed against owns wife. It is in consonance with the right to equality under the Constitution, international human rights instruments that Nepal has approved and timely changes undergone in family and criminal law to define marital rape as a crime. On these grounds the Court held that marital rape is included in the definition of rape under the prevailing law. The writ petition was dismissed on this ground. The Court felt that there is difference in degree of seriousness of rape committed by husband and other outsider woman needs special treatment in the matter of divorce and judicial separation in these case and in certain case the degree is to be determined keeping in mind the special relation of marriage and position of the husband. The Court issued a directive order to the government to introduce a bill in Parliament to provide solution in these matters.<br><br>

This decision has made very difficult to understand readers how the Court came to the conclusion that the wording of the No 1 of the chapter on Rape. It has stated other man's wife includes owns wife too. This adjective is used after unmarried, widowed intending to all types of women. And of other' should not have been completely removed through interpretation. It has been introduced form the beginning of commencement of Muluki Ain about one and half century ago that has been understood excluding owns wife from that time. And the Court has felt necessary to amend other legal provisions also to treat marital rape a crime instead of holding that marital rape also in a punishable crime and be dealt similarly with rape committed by outsider. It is submitted that it would have been better if the Court had struck down the opening words. sasdhwa wife of other" ultra vires to the Constitution. Then the marital rape also would fall in the category of crime.<br><br>

In Bal Krishna Neupane v. P.M. Girija Prashad Koirala and others (hereinafter referred to as the Tanakpur Case), the petitioner claimed that the media reported some treaties and agreements that were concluded

during the visit of the Prime Minister to India. In the press briefing from the Ministry of Water Resources, it was informed that the treaties concluded between Nepal and India was being implemented. The petitioner's contention was that he had a right to information under Article 16 of the Constitution on such treaties and agreements and prayed the Court for issuance of an order requiring the Government to give such information. The written statements of the Prime Minister and other respondents filed in this case refuted the allegation as baseless by stating that the understanding reached with the Government of India in respect of water resources during the formal visit of the Prime Minister was published in Nepal Gazette on 2048.9.8 BS. From the written statements of the respondents the Court drew an interference that they have agreed to the right of the petitioner to be informed on the understandings so reached with India on water resources.<br><br>

In this case, the Court ruled that the Constitutional system adopted by Nepal manifests its firm commitment towards democratic ideals and all its acts and conducts of the government should be essentially transparent. The Court reiterated that transparent conduct of the government provides the people the information about the public acts their representatives in the government are performing. It also provides them with an opportunity to assess whether the government has acted responsively or not. That is why HMG should provide information to the public from time to time in regards to its polices and its important decisions and public acts. The Court perceived it as the moral duty and responsibility of the government. it restated that openness in governmental actions is the cornerstone of a democratic administrative system. Cognitive of such values, the new Constitution has granted to the people the right to information as fundamental right.<br><br>

The Supreme Court also held that the activities of the government that affect the whole nation or any group or community of the public directly or duty to inform the people regarding policies adopted and the decisions indirectly /are of public importance. In such matters, the government has a

347pp



reached. These are the matter of public importance therefore the citizens have the right to demand and receive the information of such matters. 797<br><br>

The Court in this case examined the whole records submitted before it and held that the right to information was not honoured. To arrive at this conclusion the Court went into details of the Nepal Gazette where the understanding was published. The published understanding stated that the understanding reached between HMG and Government of India on water resources are hereby published for general information. The notice contained merely the description of matters without giving the head and tail portions thereof. From this, the Court threw doubt on the intentions of the government and asked the Attorney General to clarify the cause of such partial publication and to provide reasons regarding the objections that HMG had in publishing the decision as it was. The Attorney General replied that the documents being the minutes of the discussion between the two governments, the diplomatic ethics did not allow their publication. Thus, it was clear that HMG intended to keep top and bottom portions of the minutes of decisions of Indo-Nepal Joint Commission as confidential. 798<br><br>

The Court did not agree with the contention of the Attorney General on this issue. Before its final hearing the Court ordered the government to provide a copy of the Agreed Minutes of the Indo-Nepal Joint Commission, as demanded by the petition. 799<br><br>

The Tanakpur Case is a landmark case in the history of the right to information. It has been a great significance for making the government accountable and transparent. It establishes the principle that whatever treaty the government concludes needs to be published in Nepal Gazette and in publishing it the government should not hide the information that people need to judge propriety of government action. The Court advanced

bid

a theory of information jurisprudence going beyond the concept of secrecy regarding the international treaties that takes place between two or more friendly nations. In this case the whole agenda of discussion and decision reached therein was made open to public inspection through the Court order.<br><br>

This case also establishes a precedent as to what amounts to matters of public importance. The Court made it clear that a matter of public importance need not affect the whole country or nation. If it affects certain group or community it is sufficient to be a matter of public importance. The matters related to the water resources and its distribution is matters of public importance. In such matters may citizen has the right to demand the receive information, stated the decision of the Court.<br><br>

6.3.1.7.1 Status of International Law<br><br>

The international treaties of which Nepal is a party are law in Nepal. In case of inconsistency of provisions of treaty and law in force the treaty provisions have superseding effect.800 At the same time, the Constitution of the kingdom of Nepal under Article 1 has been a fundamental law of the land, and all laws inconsistent with it, to the extent of such inconsistency, are null and void. Provided, the trends of the Court, to the date, have not given a clear cut case law in this regard. The pronouncements made by the Court are confusing and contradictory to each. In a number of cases the legal provisions are challenged on the grounds that they are incompatible with the provisions of international human rights instruments, however, the Court has made simply a referential citation and discussion of such international instruments in most of the cases instead of giving a clear verdict and vision on treaty provisions. For example, in Meera Dhungana, the Supreme Court didn't hold a legal

Section 9 reads that- "in case of provision of a treaty to which the Kingdom of Nepal has become a party following its ratification, accession, acceptance or approval by the Parliament, conflicts with the provisions of current laws, the latter shall be held invalid to the dent of such conflict for the purpose of that treaty, and the provisions of the treaty shall be applicable in that connection as law of Nepal<br><br>

349pp


provision ineffective because of being incompatible with international conventions, but the Court indirectly applied the provisions through liberal interpretation of legal provision.<br><br>

In Gyan Raj Rao a genuine question was raised- whether or not there can be judicial review of treaty law. In this case, a Nepalese citizen who was retired from British Army alleged that there was discrimination and wide disparity between British Citizens and Nepalese citizens in the matter of promotion, pension and other facilities. The basis of recruitment of Nepalese citizens in the British Army is a treaty concluded between Nepal, Britain and India on 9 November 1047. In the said treaty inter alia a treaty concluded between Britain and India on 7 November 1947 was annexed. The annexed treaty has made a provision of application of Indian Pay Code to the Nepalese citizens working in the British Army. The petitioner has claimed that the provision of treaty is adversely affecting to the Nepalese nationality and the state has filed to provide equal treatment to the citizens working in the British army. He demanded the Court that the discriminatory treatments are based on a treaty and any treaty entered by Nepal is applicable, as Nepal law and the provision be declared void on the ground of inconsistency with the Constitution. He further demanded suing of an order to the government for making necessary legal and diplomatic efforts to provide equal treatment to the petitioner and other Nepalese citizens of the same footing. However, the Supreme Court without entering into the merit of the case held that though the provisions not mean that the provisions of the treaty were same as to Nepal Law in of treaty were applicable as Nepal Law by virtue of the Treaty Act, it did respects. It is a different thing to become any law applicable and to teat the Constitutionality of such law. The procedures and competency of parliament to approve a treaty and to enact a law are different. The sovisions of treaty cannot be unilaterally altered and amended and repealed by a contracting party of the treaty as the law is enacted. So, the

Decided on 2056.12.26

Constitutionality test of a law under Article 88(1) of the Constitution is not applicable to a treaty or a provision thereof. Secondly, the Court ruled that an order of a Court might be issued to discharge a legal duty of the government, whereas, the matter of treaty is subject of foreign and diplomatic relation and that comes into the domain of executive function and Court restrains itself to make any order in this mater. The issue raised by the petitioner is of a diplomatic nature that may not necessarily be solved through legal efforts. Furthermore, the issue of any order made by a Court of any contracting party does not invalidate the provision of a treaty to be applicable in another contacting state If any order is made that is futile, held the Court.<br><br>

It is quite natural that a ruling of a Court of one country cannot alter a treaty that is concluded between two or more countries. But, there are different treatment in international law between law making treaty and contract treaty. Nepal Treaty Act has also categorized treaties into two groups in Section 9(1) and 9(2) respectively. The treaties to which parliament has ratified, approved or accessed shall have superseding effect over ordinary law. Other treaty to which parliament has not ratified nor accessed nor approved, and Nepal is a party of that treaty, has no such effect.<br><br>

The effect of certiorari is to quash the administrative, judicial or quasi Judicial decision which the respective authority makes beyond his capacity or authority or in excess of jurisdiction. The grounds on which the remedy of certiorari is commonly granted are described below:<br><br>

Certiorari where there is excess of jurisdiction: An order of certiorari may be issued when the public authority acts in excess of jurisdiction.<br><br>

Certiorari where there is a breach of the rules of natural justice: An order of certiorari will be issued where the authority acts in breach of the rules of natural justice. The modern approach to alleged breaches of the rules of natural justice is to state, simply but vaguely, that an authority must not fairly having regard to the nature of the inquiry on which it is engaged. Traditionally, the rules of natural justice have been defined with a little more precision, and are said to involve two main principles- no man may be a judge in his own case, and the tribunal must hear both sides of the case. Breaches of both so-called rules can be quashed by a certiorari. Numerous cases have concerned alleged breaches of the first rule through an authority taking part in a case when he has a pecuniary interest in its outcome, or a non-pecuniary interest which is such as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion of bias. The second rule may be involved where procedural irregularities have occurred which possibly prejudiced the applicant. As regards criminal proceedings, its commonest examples are: (a) failure to give the accused reasonable time to prepare his defense. (b) failure to allow the defendant an adjournment due to a defence witness being unavailable, (c) announcing a decision of guilty before hearing a closing speech by counsel on behalf of the accused, (d) refusing to issue witness warrants, and (e) not notifying the defence of witnesses who could support their case,802<br><br>

there is an error of law apparent on the face of the record of the Certiorari where there is error of law: certiorari will be granted where

wininistrative, judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings- ie just by reading the records, and without receiving evidence or otherwise of what occurred therein, the court can tell that a mistake has been made. Historically, certiorari was developed to correct such patent errors, the effect of the

In Krishnaman case 501 it was held that the provision of competing service years of the employees from the date of HMG service whose service was converted to the government corporation service from HMG service for the purpose of retirement was not unconstitutional. The Rules observed during the service period cannot be challenged as ultra vires after retirement the Court ruled on Chandra Bahadur. The Agriculture Service (Constitution, Classification of Group and Class and Appointment! Rules, 2050 was held intra vires to the Article 124 of the Constitution in Balachanddrass. This decision was relied on earlier decisions. In another similar case the provision of competing the service period ignoring the period during the period the employee was not is service was held not in contravention to the Article 12 of the Constitution<br><br>

The Constitutionality test of reasonableness of service rules was examined in Baburam Regmi v. Ministry of Law and Justice. The provision of Civil Service Rules granting only the marks of Bachelor Degree to those holding Sive years Master Degree directly after Proficiency Certificate Level without holding Bachelor Degree was challenged on the ground of inequality. The Court held that there could be classification between the two classes of people. Classifying those holding Master Degree holders after attaining Bachelor Degree and holding Master Degree after Proficiency Certificate Level is not unconstitutional per se. But such classification must be reasonable and understandable. In the present case the provision of granting only the marks of Bachelor Degree to those holding Master degree<br><br>

degrades the Master Degree into Bachelor Degree. That is not reasonable because it lowers the qualification hold by the applicant and unreasonably restricts to competition for promotion by granting the lower marks than the applicant reasonably could have. On these grounds the Section 24(d)(2) and its illustration of the Civil Service Act, 2049 and Rule 81(2) and its illustration of Civil Service Rules 2050 were held ultra vires to the Article 11 of the Constitution.<br><br>

The Value Added Tax Act, 2052 came into force on the first day of Mangshir 2054. It has introduced a new tax system in Nepal and the laws providing the tax were challenged during the earlier years. In Rajkumar Lohia the VAT Act was challenged mainly on two points, firstly, it was discriminatory on the ground that there is no compulsory registration provisions for small entrepreneurs and secondly it restricted right to religion imposing tax on religious donations and grants and consequently some religious and charitable organizations would cease to exist due to lack of financial resources. The Court held the provisions not requiring registration of small entrepreneurs is not unconstitutional on the ground that there are no more facilities to someone and fewer facilities to someone. But the Court didn't proceed to test the reasonableness of classification On the second allegation it was held that the religious and charitable organizations are not subject to VAT unless they engage on taxable transactions. As per Sections 2(1) and 5(1) of the Act donations and grants to religious and charitable organizations are not taxable. So, the inclusion of religious and charitable organizations under the definition of "person" under the Section 2(1) of the Act doesn't restrict to exercise Right to Religion guaranteed under the Article 19 of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Kopil Prasad Adhikar 10 Section 21(2) of the VAT Act and Rules 51(1), 2) and (3) were challenged. Section 21(2) of the VAT Act provides that due Raj Kumar Lohia v. Cabinet Secretariat et.al. NLR 2056 at 339

tax cannot be recovered after the expiry of six years from the date of assessment of tax. It was alleged that this provision defeated equal protection of law and was unreasonable. The Court held that the Section 21(2) is not to be interpreted in isolation of Section 2011). The section is intended for recovery of tax from the tax defaulters. Section 21(1) gives a list of various measures for recovery and 21(2) limits the period. The Court observed the limitation is intended to recover the tax within six years. It seems the legislature intends to recover the tax within that period. Thus, the provision is not inconsistent with the Constitutional provision. In the same case Rules 51(1), (2) and (3) were also challenged on the ground that these Rules had provided separate VAT Fund to be deposited all the VAT revenue collected from import at the custom point and the credit in consolidated fund after the Department has finalized the amount to be returned to the taxpayer. The applicant claimed all the revenue collected must be credited to the consolidated fund according to Article 74 of the Constitution. The Court decided that the amount collected at the customs entry point was not final amount of revenue. That can be finalized after the taxpayer submits his/her tax return. Thus, the temporary provision of depositing the amount collected is not outside the purview of Article 74.<br><br>

In Thaneswar Kafles11 Section 42 of the Act was challenged on the ground of excessive delegation of law making power under the Section. It is in contravention to chapter 9 of the Constitution that provides the legislative procedure. The impugned Section has empowered H.M.G. to alter and change the schedules to the Act by publishing the same in Nepal Gazette. The Court held the impugned Section does not allow substituting the schedules with new ones but alterations and changes only within it. It was further held the power delegated to HMG is in the matters of economic policy of the state and falls within the jurisdiction of HMG to formulate economic policies. It requires altering and changing the schedules to the Act in consonance with economic policy that the state adopts. Thus, the

power delegated cannot be said otherwise. In fact the change of items in schedule to the Act makes taxable goods or service nontaxable and vice versa. Then the tax jurisdiction (in relation to goods and service) depends on the pleasure of executive notice. It is difficult to understand how complete substitution and alteration substantially differs in consequences. It is submitted it would have been better if the Court has discussed the theory of delegated legislation and the impugned delegation tested on these touchstone of principles of delegated legislation. It is quite difficult to comprehend the reasons of the Court in this decision.<br><br>

The Court held that levying of fees by a regulatory authority does not fall under the category of no taxation without representation in Advocate Keshab Raj Pandey, Rule 21 of Financial Regulation Rules, 2055 of the Nepal Bar Council was challenged on the ground that it has prescribed fees for updating the licensee of legal practitioner and restricting to vote for electing a body of the Council to those who fail to satisfy the conditions of updating. The petitioner contended that the said provision has restricted their freedom of profession and imposed tax without legislative authority. The Court held that there is no restriction to practice a legal profession without being updated nor the fee levied by the Rules to fulfill the objective of the Act can be held unconstitutional. Section 27(8) of the Bar Council Act authorizes to charge fees. The Court also made clear that fee and tax are different and fee does not fall within the meaning of tax under Article 73(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

The Supreme Court grappled with the determination of the Constitutionality of the Special Court Act, 1974. In Advocate Jyoti Baniya V. HMG & Others13 Section 3 and Section 5(2) of the Special Court Act. 1974 were challenged as violative of Article 85(2) of the present Constitution of Nepal. Dismissing the writ petition a Special Bench

Advocate Keshab Raj Pandey v. Nepal Bar Council NLR 2057 at 186 F.N. 216, at 4.

observed that Article 85(2) stipulated that, besides the general law Courts, the law may also establish Special types of Courts or tribunals for the purpose of hearing Special types of cases. However, it restrained from the Constitution of any Special Court or tribunal for the purpose of hearing a particular case. Thus, it was held that as the Constitution did not prohibit the establishment of a Special Court by law for the trial and disposal of any special type of cases, the act of His Majesty's Government specifying any Special types of cases for hearing by a Special Court instead of ordinary Courts might not be deemed to have adversely affected the substantive right of any person.<br><br>

The Apex Court further held that so far as the provisions contained in Section 3(1) and Section 5(2) of the Special Court Act, 1974 relating to establishment of Special type of Court even for any Special case and transferring even any particular case lodged in an ordinary Court to any Special Court were concerned, the words or special used after the word any special in the phrase any special or special types of cases contained in Section 3(1) and Section 5(2) of the concerned Act were incongruous with Article 85(2) of the present Constitution. But those words shall be deemed to have ipso facto ceased to operate, to the extent of inconsistency, one year after the commencement of the Constitution as per Article 131 of the present Constitution. Hence, as the impugned words or special contained in Section 3(1) and Section 5(2) of the Special Court Act had already become ineffective because of their inconsistency but since other provisions contained in those Sections, which were Constitutionally sound, could have their independent existence and could also remain active as usual, there was no justification for invalidating all the legal provisions of those Sections.<br><br>

Addressing another issue of Constitutionality of the establishment of a Special Court for he hearing of cases relating to offences under the Foreign Currency (Regulation) Act, 1962, the Narcotic Drugs (Control) Act, 1976, the Human Trafficking (Control) Act, 1986 and the Crimes against the State and Punishment Act, 1989, the Apex Court rightly held that since the Special Court had been established by His Majesty's Government exercising its

357pp



powers under Sections 3 and 5 of the Special Court Act, 1974 for the trial of those Special types of cases, the impugned decision of His Majesty's Government could not be deemed as unlawful. Nor could that practice be held as violative of the provisions contained in International Covenants and Conventions on Human Rights ratified by Nepal which required that hearing of cases ought to be conducted only by independent, impartial and competent law Courts.<br><br>

In Jyoti Boniya814 the exercise of judicial power by an authority that is outside the regular judicial hierarchy was questioned. Some Public (Offence and Punishment) Act 2027 has empowered Chief District Officer (CDO) to try and dispose of cases punishable under the Act. This power was questioned saying it is in ultra vires to Article 84 of the Constitutions and against the principle of natural justice- nemo judex in causa sua. It was alleged that state shall be plaintiff in these cases in accordance with the provisions of the State Cases Act, 2049 and trial and disposal of the case also falls within the executive branch. The Court ruled Article 84 states the judicial power shall be exercised by Courts and other judicial institutions and the provision of granting judicial power to CDO by Special Acts enacted by the legislature could not be held unconstitutional. But in this point the Court failed to support the decision on the basis of principles of development and functioning of quasi-judicial authorities. On the other point the nature of quasi-judicial power is characterized to hold this power does not violate the principle of nemo judex in causa sua. The Court held while trying and hearing of the cases the CDO is not acting as the State (executive) representative but he acts as a judicial authority, independently following the procedures of law. He has to exercise this power in accordance with the Constitution, laws and recognized principle. Further an appeal against his/her decision shall lie before the Appeal Late<br><br>

Court. In the same case Section 65 of Forest Act, 2049 was claimed unconstitutional stating the investigation and trial of offences under the Act by forest officers. It was alleged investigation and trials by the Chief Forest Officer are contrary to the principles of natural justice. But the Court found that the cases are to be tried by District Forest Officer and investigation to be conducted by other personnel and prosecution by Government Attorney. These officers are different and these provisions do not violate the principles of natural justice.<br><br>

In Bharat Mani Jangam v. the Parliament Secretariat & Others 16 the petitioner, a public interest activist, moved the Supreme Court assailing the Constitutional validity of Section 25 of the Parliamentarians Remuneration and Benefits Act, 1995 which provided for granting Special allowances to the members of the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly who completed their tenure or the tenure of the concerned House. The Supreme Court was called upon to decide whether the impugned Section 25 was incongruous with Article 7 of the Constitution which provided for the remuneration of the Parliamentarians. A Special Bench first upheld the locus standi of the petitioner to seek review of the impugned provision as a part of every person's Constitutional duty to uphold the provisions of the present Constitution as enjoined by Article 1(2) of the Constitution. Secondly, the Apex Court agreed to the submission that conceptually the Judiciary could not enter into the scrutiny of the legislative wisdom of the Parliament. However, it maintained that it was only trying to examine whether or not the impugned provision was in tune with the Constitution. The Apex Court observed that since allowances were granted as an incentive with a view to enhancing the competence and efficiency of any office holder, there did not arise any question of enhancement of someone's competence and efficiency after his retirement from the office. Hence, the act of granting special allowances even after the expiry of one's tenure as a Parliamentarian was constitutionally bad. The Supreme Court also refused

to buy the plea of the respondents that the Special allowances granted to the Parliamentarians might be equated with some sort of pension, as pension was a benefit meant only for employees and it would be tantamount to casting doubts on the legislative wisdom and intent of the legislature if someone contended that the Parliament had used the term special allowance as a synonym for pension. Thus, the impugned Section 25 was declared ultra vires of Article 67 of the Constitution. However, Justice Kedar Nath Upadhyaya, in his dissenting (minority) judgment, declared the impugned Section 25 as not incongruous with the Constitutional provision. This majority verdict of the Supreme Court was well received and widely acclaimed by the general public and the legal fraternity, although, of course, it annoyed and angered the lawmakers for obvious reasons!<br><br>

In Dan Bahadur 17 Rule 6(9) of the Supreme Court Rules, 2049 was challenged. The Administration of Justice Act, 2048 has granted the power of revision of its own decision in certain conditions to the Supreme Court. The said Rule provided the judges who have made earlier order or decision shall revise the previous decision or order. It was alleged it is contrary to Articles 1 (1) and 11 (1) of the Constitution. It is surprising how it is discriminatory and contrary to Article 11(1). It was further alleged it is against the rule of natural justice to revise the decision already made by himself/herself. The Court strike down this claim saying the Supreme Court has only limited power of judicial review. Like the USA Constitution it has no absolute power to declare any law ultra vires if it violates universal principles of justice, like rule of natural justice. It can review law only on appropriate grounds mentioned in the Constitution. It seems that the Court has indirectly accepted the rule has violated the rule of natural Justice. The Court held the rule of natural justice is applicable only in the

cases where there is no explicit provision of law. Where clear provision of law exists there is no application of legal principles.<br><br>

It is quite difficult to read Dan Bahadur and Jyoti Baniya in a same tune. In the former case rule of natural justice was taken as a measuring rod of Constitutionality test. The impugned laws were found not violating these rules. But in the latter case it was categorically rejected natural justice to test Constitutionality of a law. Impliedly it was accepted the law could not be challenged even if it has violated the rule of natural justice. The wording -exercise of judicial power in accordance with this Constitution, laws and recognized principle of justice- of Article 84 empowers the Court to review the law if it violates the rule of natural justice. Undoubtedly principles of natural justice are recognized principle of natural justice. Chronologically Jyoti Baniya was decided prior to Dan Bahadur. Judges deciding these two cases also are different818. The earlier case was decided six months before the latter case was decided but that was published after six month form the date of decision of the latter case. It can be clearly assumed that there was no knowledge of decision of previous case while deciding the latter. It is submitted that the result would have been different if the case were published in due time. Now it is necessary to settle the inconsistency of these two cases in deciding future cases of the same nature.<br><br>

to Article 85 and other Articles of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal and Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 1966 in Krishna Prasad Shivakoti 20. The petitioner contended that these authorities are subordinate to different Ministries of HMG and are not expert in law. The legal provisions granting judicial power to the administrative officers is contrary to Articles 84, 85, 87 90,91 and 131 of the Constitution and various treaties and conventions relating to human rights that Nepal has ratified. The Supreme Court surveyed the development of quasi-judicial bodies in general as well as its application in Nepalese judicial practices21. The Court found that the theoretical concept of vesting judicial power to the administrative officers has been accepted in Nepalese legal practice and on this basis for discharging quasi-judicial functions these authority or officers are treated as equal to a Court of law. While deciding a case their position is not of an administrative personnel (officer) but they occupy the position of judicial officer and that becomes of a quasi-judicial nature. They are required to follow the ordinary procedures to be followed by the ordinary Court or the procedure of Special Court Act, 2032, the Constitution, the law in force and recognized principles of justice and they are required to be within limitations of judicial procedures while discharging the judicial functions. The decisions of such administrative officers after following these procedures are not final ones; the relevant Acts have made provisions that the party not satisfied with the decision may file appeal to an ordinary Court against such decision. So that, finally, through appeal or special leave petition or revision the case may enter into the Supreme Court. The Court is competent to set aside the decision of such administrative officers and provide justice if there is violation of the Constitution, recognized principles of law and justice while deciding the case. Thus, the Court

ruled, it is not acceptable that such legal provisions (empowering administrative officer to try and dispose of case) are contrary to trial and disposal of case by an independent, impartial and competent judicial authority guaranteed by the Constitution and international treaties and conventions. To arrive at this conclusion the Court referred other relevant provision of the Constitution also. Article 122 was considered and the Court held that the Constitution has accepted the existence of quasi judicial authorities and the conclusion that it is contrary to the Constitution to try and dispose of cases, exercising the judicial authority. by the Administrative Officers under the respective Acts- leads to a constricted interpretation of the Constitution. In this case Court upheld the decision of Jyoti Baniya -it couldn't be accepted that the provisions the Public Offence Act, 2027 and the Forest Act, 2049 to the extent of granting authority to Chief District Officer and District Forest Officer are contrary to the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal and principles of natural justice. But still Dan Bahadur principle has not been affirmed nor rejected by the Court.<br><br>

In Bishnu Prasad 22 Section 22 was challenged on the ground that it violates Article 88(2) of the Constitution. The impugned Section provided that no question shall be raised in any Court of law against the final preparation of voters list by the Election Commission. The proviso to the said section has mentioned this condition shall not apply to an Election Special Court constituted in accordance with laws in force. It was alleged it has limited the scope of jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 88(2) of the Constitution. The Court held it is in tune with judicial specialization to limit the election disputes only within the Election Special

Court. It was further held Article 88(2) is remedial in nature. The Section 22 has provided alternative remedy in election dispute. If it becomes ineffective the appellant has right to writ jurisdiction under Article 88(2) In Peshal Dahal 23 the provisions of inclusion and exclusion of an

individual in a voters list were challenged. It was alleged that provision of Section 6 and 7 deny person residing in official quarters or hostels to be included in the voters list of their permanent residence and not in the list of the area where they are temporarily residing. The Court held that it is in the interest of public in general to be included in the voter's list in the place of permanent resident and it is inconvenience to vote outside the permanent place of residence. The section has provided exceptional cases that are not treated as permanent residence. The provision of the Section 7 may create difficulties to the voters who are residing in official quarters or hostels outside their permanent residence. They are in exceptional situations because of being student employee or worker. It is one thing not going to register and vote and it is another thing to prevent for exercising right to vote. The provision that creates difficulty cannot be challenged as unconstitutional. It is natural to have more facilities or fewer facilities to different persons in practice. Such differences cannot be held unequal treatment of law neither it can be held unreasonable restriction ignoring the conscience and reasonableness embodied in that law.<br><br>

The Court upheld the Constitutionality of anti-defection law in Prabin Kumar 24, Article 49(1) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal states the seat of a Member of Parliament shall become vacant if the party of which he was a member when elected provides notification in the manner set forth by law that he has abandoned the party. Section 5(1) (d) of the Defection of Political Party Act, 2054 has made that in certain cases there would be no defection from the political party. The section provided inter alia if forty percent or more than forty percent of the members defect

from the political party that shall not be deemed defection. There was a question whether the law mentioned in Article 49(1) of the Constitution refers to the procedural law only or the sustentative law also. The petitioner contended that the Section provides mandate to enact law only providing procedure of furnishing notice. The respondent defended that there is a mandate to prescribe the condition of defection too. The Court upheld the view of the respondent observing that the intention of the Constitutional provision is the existence of law relating to defection and notification is to be furnished according to this provision by the political party of which he was he was a member when elected. And the Court found that the provisions within the Constitutional framework and denied to enter into the legislative wisdom. But it is very difficult to be convinced how the provisions of vacating a seat after furnishing notice empowers the legislature to provide exception of ordinary meaning of defection and save the defecting members from the vice of defection. The decision does not satisfy a reader on what reasons the Court arrived at that conclusion.<br><br>

In Bharatmani Jungam825 a provision for providing pension to retired Members of the Parliament, in the name of special allowance, was challenged.

defined in the Constitution, with reference to Section 2 of the Remuneration and Facilities of Officials and Members of Parliament Act, Articles 46 and 47of the Constitution, the Court held, Article 67 provides remuneration and allowances only to 265 elected and nominated sitting Members of Parliament.<br><br>

The Court further held that after expiry of the tenure, of five years and six years, from the House of Representative or National Assembly respectively: the member cases the status of MP and becomes an ordinary individual The word "individual" falling in the impugned Section 25 also does not necessarily mean the retired person remains on the status of MP. And, ruled that the provision of Article 67 is applicable to the MPs presently holding their posts.<br><br>

The Court tested the reasons for providing salaries and allowances to the sitting MPs. And found these reasons are not applicable for providing pension after retirement from the post. Thus special allowances after retirement from the post do not seem Constitutional. It is paradoxical providing allowances to such retired people through law and not providing to ordinary citizen. Except otherwise explicitly authorized by the other Article of the Constitution it is contrary to the principle of rigid interpretation of fiscal legislation. So that, the provisions of providing special allowances to the persons who are outside the purview of Article 67 of the Constitution is not consistent with the Constitution.<br><br>

The Court further held the word remuneration as defined in the Article 123 (1) (1) does not include pension in the present case. The Court referred Article 87(10) of the Constitution where pension is mentioned and held that the word pension occurring in this Article and not occurring in Article in article 67.Further the Court held that the words pension and special 67 is meaningful. It cannot be assumed that the word pension in missing allowance are not synonymous. It is not reasonable to say that the use of her word (special allowance) includes the commonly understood meaning of pension and is contrary to the meaning of pension known to

Nepalese legal literature. In his descending opinion Justice Kedarnath Upadhyaya (as he was then) held that the pension is included in the word remuneration " as defined in Article 132(1)() of the Constitution and that falls within the purview of Article 67 and the Parliament is competent to enact law for providing pension to the retied MPs.<br><br>

The holding of the case has limited the legislative power of Parliament. In our unitary model of Constitution there is no distribution of legislative power. The limitation to this power is only the Constitution itself. The Constitution does not say Parliament shall have this and that power of legislation. Its limitations are the provisions of the Constitution and the Constitutional provisions only. Unless the legislation directly conflicts with Constitutional provisions it cannot be tested on Constitutionality. It is not necessary to show that which Article of the Constitution empowers the legislature to enact certain laws. It has residual power to legislate in any subject. So far some Articles of the Constitution are referred, in deciding the case, these state; laws shall deal in certain matters. These are not empowering provisions but creating duties on legislature to enact law in this matter. It would lead a dangerous consequence by unnecessarily and unconstitutionally limiting the legislative power of the Parliament by the Court.<br><br>

The Supreme Court declined to test the provision. It was relied on Krishna Prasad Shivakotias that the test of void and ineffectiveness arises in the case of law in force only. There were differences between the cases on which the Court relied and the present

one. In the former case there was challenge of pre-Constitutional law on the ground of inconsistency to the Constitution and that were challenged under the Article 131of the Constitution. That were effective prior to the commencement to the present Constitution and latter on question of Constitutionality was challenged. But in the latter case the provisions were enacted under the present Constitution but not were in force because the government had not brought into effect. It is not praise worthy to rely on a case that was decided on another context. There is still not clear ruling of the Court in the matter of pre Constitutional law. So it is submitted it would be better if the case had been decided without reference of that case and would have been better ruling in this point. In Krishna Prasad Shivakoti the Court ruled that there would be no Constitutionality test of pre-Constitutional law per se. It is because these laws have ceased to operate ipso facto. In case of violation of rights by operation of such laws the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Court could be prayed for. There are other cases where the Court struck down pro Constitutional law on the ground of inconsistency with Constitution. I have recommenced or uniformity in such cases in the previous issue that has not still been settled. Moreover, in Chandrakanta Gyawali pre Constitutional law was held void on the ground of inconsistency with Article 11(3). But the Court held it was void on the basis of Article 88(1) and 131. There is still more confusion and a clear ruling at the B. P. Koirala v. Nepal Government, Deputy Home Secretary, Ministry of Home is the first landmark case in the judicial history of Nepal in which the rule of natural justice was highlighted by the Court in connection with the invalid action of the executive action. In this case the petitioner's fundamental right to move freely within the territory of Nepal as guaranteed under Art. 16(D) of the Interim Constitution and sec. 2(14) of the Personal Liberty Act, 2006 (1949) was infringed by the Deputy

Secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs. The petitioner was prohibited to leave Kathmandu valley by the order of the Deputy Home Secretary. The grounds of such confinement, not to leave the valley were not provided to the petitioner. The order of the Secretary was based on the verbal direction of the Prime Minister. Under sec. 10 of the Public Security, 2007(1950) only such perform had the right to exercise the power of the public security Act who had the authority letter of the government to do so. The said Act in its sec. 2(1) (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) had categorically stated the grounds of the execution of the Act for Public Security and general welfare. The Court expressed that the Constitutional guaranteed right could not be taken away by an administrative order in the name of public security and welfare without providing the detainee the sufficient grounds and reasons for such detention order. The Court further stated that it is the fundamental principle of law and justice that a person, against whom an action is taken, must be properly informed with reasons. Any legal proceeding if initiated against him without notice and grounds, it is the violation of the rule of justice. The seriousness of the crime committed by a person and his criminal behavior hardly matter and are of least concern in relation to the grounds to be provided to the petitioner. As the fundamental rights of the petitioner had been affected by the governmental action, the Court invalidated such action by issuing the writ of certiorari and protected the right of the petitioner to freely move within the territory of Nepal.<br><br>

In Advocate Bal Krishna Neupane v. Prime Minister, Girija Prasad Koirala, the Supreme Court observed that if the question of the Constitutionality of a treaty or agreement is challenged on the ground of patent and grave error, the Supreme Court is able to see and decide the Constitutionality of a treaty or agreement like a statute as it deserves the same status under Sec. 9.1 of the Nepal Treaty Act, 1990 if it is ratified, acceded, accepted or approved by the Parliament in accordance with the Constitution of Nepal.<br><br>

In Bal Krishna Neupane v. HMG, Parliamentary Secretariat831, the Constitutional validity of Sec.2 (d) (added by the first amendment), Sec. 4(1), (3), (4) and (5), the proviso of Sec. 12 and Sec. 19(12) of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) Act, 1991 (2048) were challenged by the petitioner on the ground of their unconstitutionality with the provisions incorporated under part 12 of the Constitution relating to the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority. It was stated by the petitioner that the impugned provisions of the Act had made the Constitutional provisions ineffective and meaningless. Particularly, Sec. 2(d) had unreasonably restricted the jurisdiction of the CIAA. The special Bench of the Supreme Court reasoned that the jurisdictions of the powers of the CIAA, which is a Constitutional body, cannot be limited by an Act. If any kind of control or restriction either directly or indirectly is imposed on the CIAA, it contradicts the doctrine of Constitutional supremacy and produces a bad effect on Article 98(1), which emphatically describes the functions, duties and powers of the CIAA. The Court declared Sec. 4(5) of the CIAA Act, 1991 inconsistent with the Constitution, as it had restricted the CIAA to initiate any proceeding for the investigation of certain matters in particular circumstances 32 It also declared proviso of Sec. 12 of the Act ultra vires the Art. 98(1), (2) and (3) of the Constitution as it had restricted the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) to take suamotu action. The Court also invalidated Sec. 19(12) of the Act which had prohibited the commission from taking any action against the political appointees and in such cases the commission was required to write the Prime Minister. In case of any action against the Parliamentarians, the commission was required to write the speaker of the House of

Representatives and the Chairman of the National Assembly for approval as per the requirement of the case. It was a great defect underlying the Act and a gross violation of principles of Natural Justice. If any action against a public authority is taken on the subjective satisfaction of a certain authority it is, in no way good for the fair administration nor is it required for the healthy progress of the democratic society and the rules of Natural Justice in such case become meaningless. The Court thus declared Sec. 2(d), Sec. 4(5), proviso of Sec. 12 and Sec. 19(12) inconsistent with Art. 98(1), (2) and (3) of the Constitution and highlighted the very importance of the CIAA institution constituted directly under the fundamental law of the land. However, the Court upheld the validity of Sec. 4(1), (3) and (4) of the CIAA Act, 1991.<br><br>

In Mira Kumari Dhungana and Others v. Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs833, No. 16 of the Partition chapter of the Muluki Ain was in question. Petitioners had challenged it on the basis of Constitutional right to equality guaranteed under Art. 11 of the Constitution. The main contention of the writ petition was that the women should be given the right to property in the same way like the men and the discrimination against the woman as it exists in No. 16 of the Partition Chapter should be abolished by invalidating the impugned provision of the Ain. The Court did not invalidate the alleged provision but it issued a directory order in the name of HMG to produce a Bill for the Woman's right to property in the Parliament within one year after the order of the Supreme Court is obtained by the HMG.<br><br>

In Sapana Pradhan Malla v. HMGH, the petitioner requested the Court to strike down Sec. 26(1) of the Land Act, 1964 (2021) as it was in contravention of the Right to Equality and Right to Property guaranteed under Arts. 11 and 17 of the Constitution respectively. The alleged Provision of the Act had prohibited a daughter from inheriting the tenancy nights of her father after his death. Hon'ble J. Sri Krishna Jang Rayamajhi

speaking for the Court (Hon'ble JJ. Sri Mohan Prasad Sharma and Sri Gobind Bahadur Pradhan concurring) observed that daughter and daughter-in-law cannot be kept in the same class as the daughter-in-law belongs to the coparcener's family of the tenant while a daughter, after her marriage goes outside the family of her parents and loses her membership. Since the daughter becomes a member of a family after her marriage in accordance with the Nepalese social traditions and practices, the policy underlying Sec. 26(1) differently treats the daughter in comparison to the husband, wife and the son of the tenant. After death of the father or mother, the tenancy right gets to the son and therefore, the wife of the son (daughter-in-law) goes the tenancy right after death of her husband. The Court did not declare the alleged Sec. 26(11) of the Land Act, 1964 discriminatory and held for the Constitutional validity of the same. But, nevertheless, the Court by referring Mira Dhungana case (just above mentioned) finally issued a directory order for the HMG to take into account S26(1) of the Act, if there was any change to be required in its eye to produce a new Bill.<br><br>

In Asha Bahadur Harivans Prajapati V. the Land Revenue Offices, the Court ruled that it was necessary for a writ petitioner to clearly point out the reasons as to how a particular provision of law is ultra vires the Constitution. There is always the presumption if favour of the Constitutionality of any law. Since, the legislative Act is of very general nature and is always made for the betterment of the society, therefore, very rarely a situation arises which compels the judiciary to declare a piece of legislation ultra vires on the basis of its superior norm. Generally, the Court upholds the validity of law and it is a general principle and

declaring a law ultra vires is an exception. In Vishwadeep Adhikari v. The Parliamentary Secretariat, a similar ruling was given by the Supreme Court since the grounds of inconsistency

were not mentioned by the petitioner. The Court upheld the Constitutional validity of Sec. 19(a) and Sec. 41(e) of the Income Tax Act, 1974(2031).

In Advocate Damodar Ghimire v. HMG837 the petitioner challenged Sec. 9 of the Custom Act, 1962 (2019), Sec. 21 of the Sales Tax Act, 1966 (2053) and notices published hereunder on 14.07.2052 and 29.10.2052 in the Nepal Gazette Special Issue 46 (d) and 44(b) respectively. The Petitioner pleaded that the laws in issue were ultra vires the Constitutional right to equality as it had facilitated the elected and the nominated members of Parliament together with the other Special class persons as if they were the privileged citizens in comparison to the ordinary citizens.<br><br>

The Court rejected the contention of the writ petition and determined that absolute equality is neither possible nor required. The Court further stated that the Constitution of Nepal has given the equal protection of laws to the citizens of Nepal, who are situated under the similar circumstances, Since, the laws in question were based on the reasonable classification of the citizens, therefore, the Court declared such laws Constitutionally valid and dismissed the writ petition of the petitioner.<br><br>

The Supreme Court has thus tested numerous parent Acts on grounds of fundamental rights and sometimes, on other Constitutional provisions. But it has not tested the Constitutionality of the empowering statute on the line of excessive delegation. An act of Parliament is Supreme Legislation. It is the prime and Constitutional duty of Parliament to make required laws by keeping essential powers of legislation into its own hand.<br><br>

It is well settled that essential legislative powers cannot be delegated. Essential legislative powers consist of the determination of legislative policy and formally enacting that policy into binding rule of conduct. If the legislature delegates its function of laying down legislative policy, it is nothing but abdication of its prime Constitutional function of making laws and fixing policies. It is not at all permitted in any way and the Court can invalidate such delegation of legislative power on the touchstone of Constitutional doctrine of excessive delegation. This doctrine sets a limit

on the legislature beyond which delegation is not permitted to other way. we can say that the Court has the power to examine the Constitutionality of the empowering statute by applying the doctrine of excess datin The Courts of the other democratic countries like USA and India ha well settled the principle that essential legislative powers or Sunctions cannot be delegated. No Act has been challenged in the Supreme Court of Nepal purely on this doctrine. Therefore, this aspect of Conatinational limit on parliamentary legislation is untouched in Nepal. As the doctrine sets a limit on the legislature beyond which delegation is not permined. It is indispensable in the Nepalese context to test the Constitutionality of the Parent Act on the anvil of this doctrine where Parliament has started frequent delegating of its lawmaking power to the administration in the name of welfare state.<br><br>

6.3.3 Judicial Review of the Constitutionality of Delegated Legislation

Delegated legislation can be declared ultra sires on the ground of its inconsistency with the Parent Act. It has become an accepted principle of law that the delegated exercise of legislative power must be exercised in conformity with the principal power or authority. If delegated legislation does not conform exactly to the power granted or if it is in direct conflict with any provision of the Act, under which it is made, it can be held invalid. Rules whether made under the Constitution or a statute, must be intra vires the Parent Law under which power has been delegated. Thus, delegated legislation, repugnant to or inconsistent with or in contravention of or in excess of or overnding the provisions of the Parent Act is ultra wires. In assessing the validity of delegated legislation under the new Constitution, the Supreme Court of Nepal has started playing a creative role as it is drawing a balance between delegated legislation in one hand and the individual rights on the other, in the light of the prevailing

circumstances and the purpose of the statute in question. Major decis

of the Supreme Court under which the Court has tested the validity

delegated legislation on the touchstone of the Parent Act, ant noted below Like the empowering Act or statute delegated legislation can also be challenged on the ground of its Constitutionality. Sometimes, an empowering Act may not be found unconstitutional but delegated legislation made under it may conflict with the Constitution. Strictly speaking, delegated legislation becomes invalid on the ground of atravies the empowering Act, because an empowering Act, which is constitutional cannot be deemed to have authorized unconstitutional delegated legislation. However, it has become a usual practice and a norm that the validity of delegated legislation is directly challenged on the ground of its Constitutionality without raising the question whether it is ultra wires the empowering statute or not. Such practice has, currently, become in Nepal.<br><br>

If we survey the decisions of the Supreme Court under the new

Constitution, the Court has very rarely declared delegated legislation ultra

sires the Constitution and mostly it has upheld the validity of delegated

legislation. Some important judicial pronouncements are being noted here

to observe the judicial attitude in this regard.<br><br>

In Mira Gurung ARM Nameen The Central Immigration Department, Thamel Home Ministry, Singh Durbar, the Petitioners challenged R. 14 (3) and R. 14 (4) of the Alien Rules, 1975 as inconsistent with Art. 11 of the Constitution, which guarantees the Constitutional right to equality of a citizen. Rule 14(3) had afforded a foreign wife of a native husband the right to visa while R. 14(4), on the other hand, had restricted this right to an alien husband of a native wife. The petitioners challenged the impugned Rule discriminatory under Act. 11 of the Constitution as it were framed on the basis of sexual discrimination. The Court declared the impugned provisions of the Alien Rules

discriminatory but at the same time, the Court did not declare the

provisions null and void. It argued that the new Immigration Act, 1992 had already repealed the Alien Act, 1952 and hence the rules made there under was already inoperative and there was no need to declare such rules null and void.<br><br>

In Badri Kumar Basnet v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers Hon'ble J. Sri Rudra Bahadur Singh speaking for the Special Bench of the Supreme Court clearly stated that the Court can determine the Constitutionality of rules only if a petitioner produces necessary grounds of inconsistency of such rules. In this case, the petitioner had not shown the grounds as to how R.7 (1)(3) of the Civil Service Rules, 1964(2021) was inconsistent with the Constitutional right to equality. Therefore, the Court did not declare the alleged rule ultra vires the Constitution.<br><br>

In Ram Chandra Gautam v. HMG, Ministry of Information and Communication, the Constitutional validity of the Bye-law 1.1(3) of the Gorkhapatra Corporation Personnel (service condition) Bye-laws, 1990 (2047) was in question as it had contravened the right to equality clause of the Constitution. As the grounds of inconsistency were not clearly mentioned by the petitioner, the writ petition was dismissed.<br><br>

In Ganesh Kafle v. The Chairperson, National Sports Council, once again the apex Court highlighted the importance of grounds to invalidate a law in question. The petitioner in this case had challenged R.9.3 of the Sports Council (Employees Service Conditions) Rules, 1992 (2049) as inconsistent with the Constitution. The grounds of inconsistency were not clearly mentioned under the petition. The Court ruled that the grounds as to why a law in question is inconsistent with the Constitution should be clearly and specifically mentioned in the writ petition. If it is not so, the law in question is always intra vires the Constitution.<br><br>

In Mohan Bahadur K.C. v. HMG the Constitutionality of the amended sub-rule (3) of Rule 9.15 of the Civil Service Rules, 1964 (2021) was in question. This amended provision had forbidden particularly, the gazette officers from being the members of the Civil Servants Organisation. The petitioner challenged the impugned rule ultra vires the Constitutional right to equality. The Court in determining the Constitutional validity of the alleged rule reasoned that there is a great difference between the gazetteri civil servants and the non-gazetted civil servants. The powers and functions of the gazetted civil servants are quite different from that of the powers and functions of the non-gazetted civil servants. The gazetted civil servants hold distinct responsibilities and occupy special position in comparison to the non-gazetted civil servants. They (particularly of higher ranks) formulate the principles and policies of the state and execute them. Therefore, they create a separate class, which is quite different from that of the class of the non-gazetted civil servants. Since the classification is based on rational criteria, as likes are treated alike, therefore, the impugned provision of the Civil Service Rules is completely inconformity with the Constitutional right to equality. The Court thus upheld the Constitutionality of the rule in dispute.<br><br>

In Trilochan Gautam v. HMG, Ministry of Finances, the petitioner challenged the notice of the Ministry of Finance, published on 29.10.2051 (1994) in the Nepal Gazette, on Constitutional ground as it had contravened the right to equality incorporated under Art. 11(1) of the Constitution. The Court once again explained the equality clause on the basis of the term protective discrimination and stated that if the persons who are likely situated, are treated on unequal footing, in such a situation the principle of equality is violated. Since, the members of the House of Representatives as well as the National Assembly had been provided the concession for custom duty and sales tax, as they were differently situated in comparison to the general citizens, therefore, the notice of the concerned Ministry was quite valid and not incontravension of the

constitutional guaranteed right to equality. The Court, thus, upheld for the validity of the notice.<br><br>

In Jeevan Kumar Ghimire v. The Nepal Rastra Bank, the Court once again observed the principle of equality on the rationale of reasonable classification. The Court stated that a person, who has the experience of work in the Banking Office, and a person, on the other hand, who newly appearing candidate, just to enter and entertain a job cannot be kept on the same footing for the like treatment.<br><br>

In Devaki Prasad Chaurasiya v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the petitioner claimed that R. 14(4) of the Municipality (working management) Rules, 1992 (2049) was inconsistent with R. 87(1) of the Civil Service Rules, 1993.<br><br>

The Court observed that Art, 88(1) of the Constitution is not meant for declaring a certain rule inconsistent with some other rules. There is no question of one delegate being lower than the other delegate in status. In other words, the status and character of the rulemaking authorities are irrelevant as both are the delegates of the legislature. If two different Acts confer their lawmaking power to frame rules differently on their subordinates, there is no question of inconsistency between the two sets of rules or one will prevail over the other as they carry out the similar status and made for some different purposes under the delegation of legislative power.<br><br>

The question whether bye-laws can restrict a rule or prevail over it, was determined in Hari Prasad Sharma v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, The Court ruled that the HMG can formulate rules not contrary to the objectives of the Parent Act. Since the HMG is empowered by the Act to frame necessary rules, therefore, such delegated right cannot be controlled, restricted or narrowed down by the bye-laws. Sometimes, a question arises that a writ petitions to invalidate a particular piece of

legislation under Art. 88(1) of the Constitution is placed only before the Special Bench of the Supreme Court or the other Bench in also capable of doing the same. This question was determined by the Division Bench of the Supreme Court in Binod Prasad Adhikari u. Sri Director General Department of Tourism, The Court reasoned that the petition for the question of the Constitutionality of law filed under Art 8811) of the Constitution undoubtedly be placed before the Special Bench of the Supreme Court. But nevertheless, the Court further stated that the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to examine the Constitutionality of any law, cannot be exercised by any other Bench, except the Special Bench is neither embodied under the Constitution nor is it prohibited by the Supreme Court Rules, 1992 (2049). Though the Supreme Court Rules, 1992 has categorized the cases of different nature to be presented before a certain Bench of the Supreme Court for decision. it does not refer that the other Bench of the Court cannot interpret the Constitution and cannot have the ability to declare an inconsistent law void on the basis of the Constitutional provision or any other law. The Court thus stated that any Bench of the Supreme Court or the each and every Bench is equally competent to interpret the Constitution and declare an unconstitutional law void. It hardly matters whether the issue is put before the Special Bench or the Division Bench of the Supreme Court. The above decisions of the Supreme Court show that the Court has always presumed in favour of the Constitutionality of delegated legislation. However, there are two important decisions in which the apex judiciary has very carefully declared the subordinate legislation ultra vires on the touchstone of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Tirtha Koirala v. HMG, Ministry of General Administration, the petitioner, who was a journalist, challenged the amendment of R. 106(d)(8) of the Civil service Rules, 1993 (2050) made by the HMG on 03.07.2050 as unconstitutional as it had empowered the HMG to decide over the matter of departmental action taken against the Registrar of the Supreme Court

by the Supreme Court judge. The impugned provision had provided an appellate jurisdiction to the HMG to test right or wrong over the decision of judge of the Supreme Court. The petitioner claimed such impugned provision of law as inconsistent with Art. 92 and Art 94(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

Art. 92 of the Constitution states that a judge shall not be transferred to, engaged in, or deputed to, any work except that of a judge

Provided that His Majesty may, in consultation with the judicial council, depute for a specified period a judge of the Supreme Court or a Chief Judge of any Appellate Court to work concerning judicial inquiry, to legal or judicial investigation or research, or to any other work of national concern. With regard to other judges of the Appellate Courts and District Courts, the Chief Justice may, in consultation with the Judicial Council, depute them to the above works, including election works.<br><br>

The above provision of the Constitution does not empower the HMG to utilize the judges of the Nepalese Courts for any purpose except the Constitutional provision and thus preserves the integrity and dignity of judges. The Court in testing the impugned rule reasoned that the first amendment of R. 106(d)(8) of the Civil Service Rules, 1993, which had empowered the HMG to review the decision of a Judge of the Supreme Court and thereafter to decide for the right or wrong regarding the departmental action against the Registrar of the Supreme Court was against the principle of the independence of judiciary which is the basic structure of the Constitution. The Court further observed that it is not the executive organ which has the power of judicial control over the judiciary rather it is the fundamental and indispensable character of the independence of judiciary, which empowers the Supreme Court to examine the Constitutionality and legality of the administrative action and thus provide judicial control over the administration. The Court stated that if anything which is done either directly or indirectly and which adversely affects the spirit of the independence of judiciary is contrary to the fundamental law of the land. The Court also declared the impugned

380pp


rule contrary to Art. 94(1). Art. 9411) states that if any departmental action is taken against any gazetted officer of the judicial service by the HMG, the recommendation of the Judicial Service Commission is a must. Since the Registrar of the Supreme Court is a gazetted special class officer, therefore if any action is taken against him the recommendation of the judicial Service Commission is the primary requirement.<br><br>

The alleged rule had empowered the HMG to fix a judge of the Supreme Court to take the departmental action against the Registrar of the Supreme Court and thereafter it had again conferred power on the HMG to hear appeal against the action taken by a judge so fixed. Therefore, the Court declared it in contravention of Article 94(1) of the Constitution. The Court declared R.106(d)(8) of the Civil Service Rules, 1993 null and void, as it was contrary to the concept of the independence of judiciary as well as inconsistent with Articles 92 and 94(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

In Basant Bahadur Shrestha v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the petitioner challenged Rule 120(1) of the Education Rules, 1992(2049) on the touchstone of Education Act, 1971(2048). Rule 120(1) of the Education Rules, 1992 had stated that the property of a private school would remain private, if the school is properly conducted. If it in not so, the right of the private school to hold property would no longer continue and such property would be converted into public property

The Court observed that it was only the supreme legislature, ie, Parliament, which had the power to change the private property into public property by enacting laws. The controversial R. 120(1) had no authority to change the nature of the property. The Court further stated that the right to property is not an absolute right, but to restrict such right or to impose a limitation on it by changing its nature is not the power and function of the administration, rather it is the power and function of the legislature which can confer this power and function on the administration by using clear wordings and phraseologies under the relevant Act. Since the impugned Rule 120(1) had changed the nature of

the property and exceeded the limitations of the parent Act without an authority to do so, the Court declared it ultra vires the Education Act In Advocate Bal Krishna Neopane v. HMG. Secretariat of the Council of

Ministers, the Court declared sub-rule 4(a), (b) and (c) of Rule 3 of the Citizenship Rules, 1992 (2049) void ab initio as it had fixed some additional grounds except the grounds determined under the Constitution and the Citizenship Act for the acquisition of citizenship without the delegation of legislative power. The Court observed that a rule making body is not competent to frame rules without the authority of law. If the rules, which are made to fulfill the objectives of the Act, fix some additional grounds or criteria of acquiring citizenship without the delegation of legislative power, such rules or the criteria underlying therein are ultra vires the Act and therefore void.<br><br>

In Mohan Bahadur Shrestha v. Telecommunication Corporation, Central Office$53, once again, the Apex Court invalidated the subordinate legislation on the anvil of the supreme legislation. In this case, the petitioner was given retirement under bye-laws, 101(6) of the Telecommunication Bye-laws, 1976(2033) which had fixed the age criteria for the retirement of permanent employees as 20 years, if the corporation thought to provide retirement to any of the employees. The claim of the petitioner was that the impugned bye-law was framed in contravention of Sec. 16 read with Sec. 2(f) of the Telecommunication Corporation Act, 1971(2028), as the appointment, conditions of service and tenure of personnel's of the corporation were the subject matter of rules made by the HMG under the delegation of legislative power. Sec. 36 of the Telecommunication Corporation Act, 1971 had empowered the corporation to frame bye-laws just for its proper management of work. The Court declared the impugned bye-law. Ultra vires the Act as it had exceeded the jurisdiction allotted to it. The Court also issued a writ of mandamus in the name of the corporation to reinstate the petitioner on the same post.<br><br>

Act, 1991 (2048) and under Rule 72(a) of the Village Development (working management) Rules, 1993 (2050), was in Dispute

The Court reasoned that the above provisions of the V.D.C. Act, 1991 and V.D.C. Rules 1993 had not empowered the HMG to issue any directory, therefore, the issuance of such Directory was unauthorized and unlawful exercise of power of the administration. The Court declared such Programme Directory null and void.<br><br>

In Murli Gopal Ranjitkar and Others v. HMG, Council of Ministers, Singh Durbaress, Rule 79 of the Civil Service Rules, 1993 (2050) was challenged on grounds of its inconsistency with Sec. 58 of the Civil Service Act, 1992 (2049) and the Constitutional right to equality. The petitioners claimed the rule in question was not formulated in accordance with the aims and objectives of the Constitution and the Act nor was the judicial mind applied by the HMG in formulating the rule in issue. The main contention of the petitioners were that the service conditions of the petitioners were that the services conditions of the employees or the civil servants could not be changed without the prior approval of the concerned employees. According to Sec. 58 of the Civil Service Act, 1992 prior approval was made necessary in this context.<br><br>

The Court reasoned that the prior approval of the employees was required in case of an adverse change in financial facilities like gratuity, pension or the like under Sec. 58 of the Civil Service Act, 1992. Rule 79 of the Civil Service Rules, 1993 had not curtailed the facilities of the employees granted under Sec. 58 of the Act. Rather it had fixed the criteria for the promotion of the employees on the reasonable basis and was in no way relevant with financial security. The Court further stated that the Constitution of service and creation and termination of post etc. of the

civil servants are directly related to and dependent on the policies of the HMG. The HMG, therefore, can manage for the essential, reasonable and proper conduction and development of the administration in accordance with the Constitution, Act, accepted principles of justice and law and general conscience. Thus, the Court upheld the validity of the impugned Rule 79 of the civil service Rules.<br><br>

In Suresh Mohan Bhandari and Others v. The Public Service Commission, the Court observed that if the academic qualification is determined by rules for a certain post and the public service commission notifies the same for the fulfillment of such post, it cannot be said that the notice is without the basis of law and therefore, discriminatory. The Court further stated that if the academic qualification is determined for a certain post, it can continue to remain the same forever, is neither logical nor reasonable. Therefore, if a change is brought by the Civil Service Rules regarding the qualification of a certain post it is not repugnant to the fundamental right to equality nor is it in contravention of the provisions of the Civil service Act. Thus, the apex judiciary held for the validity of the rule in issue.<br><br>

In Shrimati Ninimaya Maharjan V. HMG Secretariat of the Council of Ministers 57, once again the Court upheld the validity of delegated legislation and stated that merely by saying Rule 25(1) of the Minerals Rules, 1961 (2018) is not sufficient. How such rule is inconsistent should be clearly and categorically mentioned by the petitioner.<br><br>

6.3.3.1 Unreasonableness<br><br>

Unreasonableness is an implied restriction on delegated legislation. It is presumed that legislature does not intend to confer power to make unreasonable rules. Therefore, such rules, which are not reasonable, may be declared ultra vires by the Court. But, unless a rule is manifestly unjust, capricious, inequitable or partial in operation it cannot be

856 NLR 2053 at 575.

157 NLR 2053 at 627.

384pp


invalidated on the ground of unreasonablenesses The principle of unreasonableness originates from Krusev Johnson and Arlidge V Islington Corporation and it is applied generally to bye-laws made by local authorities and not to rules made by government departments One rationale for this is that the Court should trust the discretion of a Minister, because he is directly responsible to Parliament<br><br>

Nepal has a written Constitution. Therefore, the principle of unreasonableness is based on the solid foundation of the Constitution The unreasonable piece of delegated legislation may also be hit by the fundamental rights of citizens guaranteed under the Constitution. Even parliamentary legislation is also not immune and it can also be tested an the touchstone of the Constitution, whether it is reasonably made or not. The unreasonable piece of legislation may be hit by Article 11 of the Constitution which guarantees right to equality and which outlaws the unreasonableness. Art. 12 guarantees right to freedoms in several ways but these freedoms are not absolute and laws can be made by the state to impose reasonable restrictions on each political freedom guaranteed under Art. 12(2) separately. Again, there are other fundamental rights. Le., right to property, right to information etc. guaranteed under the Constitution, but they are also not absolute and they can be reasonably restricted for public purposes, or for secrecy as per the case may require. Unconditional freedom leads a society towards anarchy and destruction and provision for freedom is best where it is coordinated with related duties. The scope of the test of unreasonableness is wider in Nepal as the Supreme Court can imply the concept of unreasonableness not only from the common law as is done in England on the basis of parliamentary legislation but also from the Articles of the Constitution.<br><br>

Administration and Others, Babu Ram Poudel v. HMG, Secretariat of the council of Ministers, Sita Bisto Keshtri u. HMG, Ministry of Home Affairs etc, the petitioners have raised the voice against unreasonable restrictions imposed on their basic rights by law and the Supreme Court has also very assertively taken the matter into concern but the petitioners have challenged laws, either supreme or subordinate and begged before the Court to invalidate the same on the ground of their Constitutionality which is already discussed. Any law is not challenged solely on the ground of the principle of unreasonableness, as it is an implied restriction on any law. Therefore, the Court has not utilized this principle in the real sense of the term.<br><br>

The other component of ultra vires doctrine is procedural ultra vires. Delegated legislation is supposed to comply with the procedural requirement if it is prescribed by the empowering Act. Failure to comply with such requirement leads to procedural ultra vires. The empowering Act may require the rule-making authority to follow some prescribed procedures while making rules. If the rule making body does not follow the prescribed procedures in the making of such rules, the rules may be declared invalid by the Court. The Parent Act may require the delegate to consult with particular bodies or interests, to publish the draft of rules or bye-laws, in draft or final form, to lay them before Parliament etc. In such a situation the delegate is under an obligation to comply with the prescribed procedures in the same manner prescribed under the parent statute.<br><br>

The procedural requirement may be either mandatory or directory. In case of the mandatory procedural requirement, it must be meticulously observed. In case of the directory procedural requirement, non-compliance with the procedure does not necessarily invalidate delegated legislation. Sometimes, the Court decides by its interpretation whether the procedural requirement is mandatory or directory and thus the importance of

procedural requirement is finally determined by the Court by taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of each case and the object of the concerned statute.<br><br>

No question has been raised under this Constitution, to declare delegated legislation void on the ground of procedural ultra vires. However, one case is remarkable in which the Court has highlighted the importance of procedural requirement.<br><br>

In Chuda Nath Bhattarai v. The Nepal Public Service Commissions, the Court issued a directory order in the name of the Public Service Commission to reframe the syllabus of the Public Service Commission in which Nepali subject was deleted from the course of PSC examination. The Court stated that the PSC had not followed the procedure incorporated under proviso clause of Sec. 8(1) of the Public Service Commission Act, 1991 (2048). The said proviso clause had contended that the syllabus and the academic qualification for the examination of the PSC shall be settled by the PSC in prior consultation with the concerned Ministry and Secretariat. The Chairperson of the PSC had not consulted the same rather he had taken the advice of the gazetted officers of the commission without the provision of law.<br><br>

The Court ruled that the consultation with the concerned Ministry or Secretariat to know its opinion was not merely a formality but a mandatory procedural requirement to elaborately think over the subject matter in question. The Court further stated that the Nepali language in Devnagri script is the language of the nation and the official language; therefore its importance cannot be reduced or undermined. Again the Court expressed that Art. 102 of the Constitution which describes the functions, duties and powers of the PSC specifically incorporates in its clause (6) that the other functions, duties and working procedures of the PSC shall be as regulated by law, therefore, it was necessary requirement for the PSC to do its duty within the ambit of the Constitution and in accordance with the procedure determined by law.<br><br>

An overview of the judicial control of delegated legislation shows that after the reinstatement of democracy under the present Constitution, it is on a fairly wide scale. Previously, it was in a limited sphere. Presently, particularly the Special Bench of the Supreme Court under its extra ordinary jurisdiction is playing a crucial role in this regard. The flood of writ petitions in one hand and the independence of the judiciary on the other, both together have enabled the Supreme Court to test the Constitutionality or validity of legislation time and again. The judiciary has generally shown its reluctant attitude to invalidate legislation, as there is always the presumption in favour of the Constitutionality of law, but, nevertheless, there are ample of cases and numerous examples in which the judiciary has invalidated the law in question and provided justice to the people at large.<br><br>

The Supreme Court has tested the validity of law on several grounds. It has examined the Constitutionality of the empowering Act as well as the delegated legislation on the anvil of the Constitution. However, the doctrine of excessive legislation has not come into focus. The Court has also tested rules, regulations, bye-laws, notices etc. on the ground of parent legislation and the doctrine of ultra vires has exhaustively prevailed during a short period of time. Regarding the principle of unreasonableness, the Court has not tested delegated legislation on the touchstone of empowering legislation by applying this principle. The petitioners have challenged the Act and delegated legislation on the ground of its Constitutionality and in that connection they have raised the voice that a certain piece of legislation has imposed an unreasonable restriction on their guaranteed fundamental rights but truly speaking no case has been instituted independently on this ground as the principle is related to the implied restriction on any law. Regarding the procedural ultra vires, no delegated legislation is challenged on this ground but nevertheless, the Supreme Court has expressed that the clear-cut language of law if prescribes a certain procedure to be followed by the administration, that cannot be avoided by it. If it is so, such type of action, either legislative or administrative, is liable to be quashed.<br><br>

The grounds for the judicial control delegated noted above are necessarily very important but not exhaustive. There may arise a situation when a petitioner can challenge delegated legislation on principle of natural justice, malafides or wrongful purpose, subjective language and so on and so forth. The trend of the writ petition of the citizens shows that days are to come in the future when a citizen can bring a new issue before the Apex Court to test the validity of delegated legislation.<br><br>

In Bal Krishna Neupane v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Ministers, the petitioner prayed in the Supreme Court that he was denied information as to the Action Plan that took place between India and Nepal in 2050.9.13 BS. He invoked Article 16 of the Constitution to obtain such information. Based on the ratio of the Tanakpur case, the Court did not find reasons to withhold the Action Plan that was formalized between India and Nepal.868 Hence, the Supreme Court issued a writ of mandamus against the respondents to provide the Agreed Action Plan to the petitioner. The Action Plan contained that there will be a separate treaty between these countries after preparing the detailed technical report relating to water resources development and upon the agreement for the implementation of such report. The report inter alia shall include feasibility study, research and survey, which will show the economic cost of resources869 as well.<br><br>

The Supreme Court, in this case, reiterated that the Constitution has envisaged a democratic and accountable government where the functioning of the government has to be transparent. To ensure this, every Nepali citizen has the right to demand and receive information regarding the policies, public actions and decisions of HMG, which affect general public directly or indirectly.<br><br>

In Advocate Bal Krishna Neopane v Parliamentary Secretaria, the Constitutional validity of Sec. 4(1) of the Labour Act, 1991 was challenged by the petitioner as it had violated the Constitutional provision embodied under Art. 12 (2) (e) of the Constitution, which guarantees the freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, industry or trade of a citizen. The petitioner claimed that Parliament had no right to enact any law granting such right to the foreign citizens.<br><br>

The Special Bench of the Supreme Court (Hon'ble JJ Gajendra Keshari Banstola and Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya Concurring) declared the second sentence of the alleged See 4(1) while making such appointments priority shall be given to the Nepalese Citizens null and void ab initio pursuant to Art. 88(1) of the Constitution.<br><br>

The Court held that the rule enacted under the delegated power of the Act cannot go beyond the limitation and objective of the Parent Act. The rule must be consistent with the Act and the Act with in Constitution, held the Court. The Court also observed that the right not conferred in the Act could not be conferred on by the rule. The state has vested the parliament, consists of elected representatives of the people, the responsibility of enacting the law. The function of the Court is merely to interpret the law. The Court should always take the parliamentary law positively and as being consistent with the Constitution until the Constitutionality of such law is questioned and proved accordingly, held the Court. The Court also held that it generally did not want to make interference in the legal validity of state made law. Applying the doctrine of severability the Court held that in case the law is partly valid and partly invalid the Court has to declare Ultra vires to the invalid part of the law and leave the rest part as valid.<br><br>

In Indrakant Mishra v. Magistrate, Bhuvneshwar Singh, the Magistrate's order to close the publication of the daily Dainik Nepal' under sec. 36 of the Press and Publication Act, 2009(1952) was set aside by the Court. It was reasoned by the Court that the action of the administration to close the publication of 'Dainik Nepal', under sec. 36 of the Act was a quasi judicial action as the action had affected the petitioner's right guaranteed under sec, 6 of the Civil Liberty Act, 2013 (1956). Therefore, it was the duty of the administration to provide the petitioner an opportunity to defend his case. Since the Magistrate had reached the decision by violating the rule of fair hearing, therefore, his decision to band the publication of the impugned paper was invalidated by the Court on the ground of natural justice.<br><br>

In Meena Karki u. the Land Reforms Office, Jhapa", the order of the Division Bench was revised by the Full Bench of the Supreme Court.

The Court expressed that the defendant, Land Reform Office had taken an erroneous decision based on isolation and in the absence of the petitioner. The Court quashed such decision of the authority as it was erroneous and contrary to the rule of natural justice and issued the writ of Mandamus in the Land Reform Office, Jhapa, to decide the case in accordance with law.<br><br>

the requirement of justice, it does not mean that this requirement can be fulfilled at the disposal and convenience of the petitioner. Therefore, if a reasonable opportunity is given for a hearing, that is quite sufficient to satisfy the requirement of natural justice.<br><br>

In Parshuram Jha v. Secretariat of the Council of Ministers et apa, the Full Bench of the Supreme Court held that the reasons and their basis, the charges against a civil servant and the evidences to substantiate such charges, the adequacy of such evidences and the merits for dismissal, they all should be clearly taken into account by the authority, if a civil servant is ousted from his job. If the above procedural requirements are not maintained by the concerned authority for dismissing a person from job, the order is erroneous and liable to be quashed.<br><br>

The principle of natural justice is a check upon the administration as it imposes a restriction even in case of disciplinary action as such action is also not unlimited or unrestricted. The Court emphasized that the term *appropriate and sufficient reasons" under the Civil Service Rules lay down fair procedure against the dismissal of a civil servant. If such written procedural requirement is not under the law, even then a minimum requirement of fair procedure is required to be maintained.<br><br>

The petitioner challenged sec. 12 of the Special Service Act as inconsistent with Art. 16 which guarantees the right to information of a citizen. The petitioner claimed that it was against the principle of transparency, therefore a gross violation of rule of natural justice and rule of law contemplated under the Constitution. Though the Court did not declare the alleged section as contrary to Art. 16 of the Constitution, it highlighted the importance of natural justice and stated that the grounds and causes for hearing were necessary to be supplied to the petitioner.<br><br>

In Bharat Prasad Bhandari v. HMG06, the petitioner was given compulsory retirement after the expiry of a fixed tenure, which was applicable to all which were likely situated.

In Rukma Shumsher Rana v. HMG, Secretariat of the Council of Minister the Court observed, if any action is taken against any member of the national games and sports, he is required to be given an opportunity to be heard as hearing has become an essential phenomena in the present democratic age. Therefore, if a person is dismissal from his post without any notice and ground, there can exist the monopoly of the administration and good governance of the country can become meaningless.<br><br>

Babu Ram Paudel v. HMG is a landmark case from the point of view of natural justice. The petitioner was given forced retirement under R. 7. 1 (3) of the Civil Service Rules. The concerned authority had not provided the grounds for such retirement. The authority had not contemplated sec. 7(3) of the Civil Service Act, 2013(1956) which had incorporated the proceedings of the retirement of Civil Servants. The Court declared such decision of retirement ultra virus the Art. 11(1) which guarantees right to equality The Court by issuing the writ of mandamus ordered HMG to reinstate the petitioner in the same post by quashing the illegal decision of the administration and the right of the petitioner to hold the post and continue the service was protected by applying the principle of the natural justice.<br><br>

In Krishna Prasad Pandey v. HMG, Ministry of Home Affairs, the petitioner was detained under sec. 3(1) of the Public Security Act, 1989,911 He was not given the chance of hearing. Grounds of his detention were also not provided to him. The Court quashed such detention order of the authority as the order was inconsistent with the rule of natural justice. The Court expressed the action of administration as clear-cut violation of Art 15(1) of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal, 1990 which guarantees the Right against Preventive Detention and says that no person shall be held under preventive detention unless there is a sufficient ground of existence of an immediate threat to the sovereignty, integrity or law and order situation of the kingdom of Nepal.

It is a general principle of law that a man is presumed to be innocent until proved guilty. The Court therefore, stated that it has become an established principle of the modern jurisprudence that the legal aid should be provided to every citizen who is very poor or economically unsound and cannot defend his case properly.

However, in Dan Bahadur Prajapati v, Sheri Hon'ble Speakers, the Supreme Court provided a strict meaning of the principle of natural justice. In this case the petitioner claimed that R. 6(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 2047(1990) was inconsistent with the principle of natural justice as it had empowered the same judge of the Supreme Court to review the case who decided the case. The Court expressed that Art 88(1) of the Constitution of the kingdom of Nepal, 1990 empowers the Court the power of judicial review and to declare a law void in case it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of fundamental rights conferred by this Constitution or on the ground of inconsistency of any law with the Constitution. The Court by referring to the Constitution of the USA stated that the Constitution of Nepal has not conferred upon the judges of the Supreme Court, the power of absolute judicial review as the Constitution of the USA declares a law unconstitutional on the general principle of law like the principle of Natural Justice. The Court thus ruled that the principle of natural justice cannot be applied in case where there is a clear provision of law as the principle of natural justice is a general principle or a matter of theoretical consideration. Therefore, it is applied where there is no clear provision of law. The Court thus upheld the validity of the impugned R. 6(1) of the Supreme Court Rules, 1990 and minimized the scope of natural justice.<br><br>

The Court observed, if any person like the petitioner, is ousted from his position before the completion of his legally fixed tenure it is the basic requirement of justice and general legal procedure that he should be given reasons for his removal as well as an opportunity to be heard. If it is not so, the general requirement of fair procedure is not fulfilled and therefore, such abusive exercise of power, on subjective satisfaction is liable to be quashed as it leads to uncertainty and controversy in the field of law and justice.<br><br>

In Hargobind Maharjan v. Ravikant Manandhar and others, the Ministry of Home had changed and corrected the father's name of the petitioner written in the Nepal citizenship certificate by its decision on 2055-09-07. The petitioner as aggrieved person was not consulted in such a sensitive and vital issue. The Division Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Hon'ble JJ Shri Bhairab Prasad Lamsal and Shri Gopal Prasad Khatri stated that the Ministry of Home had no right to see and decide about the question of the Nepal citizenship certificate of a particular citizen in isolation as to who is the father of a citizen and therefore, of the petitioner. The Court expressed that no law provides such right to the Ministry of Home to see, change and correct the father's name of the petitioner already mentioned under the Nepal Citizenship certificate without consulting the petitioner. As the petitioner was not given an opportunity to express his opinion and the decision of the Home Ministry was taken in isolation by debarring the petitioner from the hearing, the Court invalidated such decision of the Ministry of Home taken on 2055-09-07 as

In Visan Prasad Tharu v. Regional Education Directorate, Mid-region and others916, the Education Directorate had removed Vishan Pd. Tharu from the post of the chairman of the School Managing Committee of Deep Narayan Secondary School. The Directorate had not provided the grounds for his removal. The Directorate had not shown that the writ petitioner had violated part (a) to (e) of R. 17(1) of the Education Rules (Sixth Amendment), 2049. It had also not shown that the petitioner had not obeyed the legal provision incorporated under r. 17(1) of the said Education Rules. The petitioner was not given an opportunity to defend his case despite the legal provision of fair hearing nor was the Directorate in a position to say that the petitioner had not performed his responsibilities properly. The Court by concentrating upon the rule of natural justice, highlighted sec. 12 a(1) of the Education Act, 2028 and expressed that the Regional Education Directorate has the right to dissolve the School Managing Committee and it can do so if the School Managing Committee does not properly fulfill its assigned responsibilities. But nevertheless, the grounds of such dissolution of the committee and the right of fair hearing must be extended to the committee to defend it as necessary legal requirements. Thus, the Division Bench of the Supreme Court comprising Hon'ble JJ Shri Kedarnath Acharya and Shri Meen Bahadur Rayamajhi declared the decision, dated 2056-09-06 of the Regional Education Directorate and the letter written by the District Education Office, Parsa on 2056-09-08 there under to remove the petitioner unlawful and therefore invalidated such decision by the writ of certiorari and issued the writ of mandamus in the name of the opponents to reinstate the petitioners in the same position to work.<br><br>

In Bhawani Devi Sharma v. Managing Committee, Nepal Bank Ltd., the petitioner Bhawani Devi Sharma had been appointed as the acting General Manager of the Nepal Bank Ltd. by the decision of the Managing Committee of the Bank on 2056-01-27, She had worked as the General Manager of the Bank for about 28 months continually. Contrary to this a decision of the Managing Committee taken on 2058-05-08 made Bhavnath Upadhyaya the General Manager of the Bank. The ground and cause for his appointment whether he was promoted or freshly appointed for such post, were not made clear. The petitioner asked the Court to declare such erroneous decision of the committee void by issuing the writ of certiorari and appoint the petitioner as the General Manager in accordance with the Nepal Bank Ltd. Personnel Rules, 2048 (1991) by issuing the writ of mandamus in the name of the Managing Committee. The Division Bench of the Supreme Court quashed the decision of the Managing Committee of the Nepal Bank Ltd. and observed that the Managing Committee had not provided the reasons as to how the petitioner was not fit to carry out her responsibilities nor had the committee given any reasonable and justified reason for the appointment of Bhavnath Upadhyaya as the General Manager. The Court further expressed that the committee had not followed the clear provisions of the rules and appointed Mr. Upadhyaya on grounds of prejudice and subjective satisfaction. Since the decision was contrary to the rules as well as the propounded principles of law and justice, the Court invalidated the decision of the committee and also issued the writ of mandamus for the proper appointment of such vital post of General Manager. The Court in this case also referred the previous case like Manirajan Baral v. Council of Ministers and others (De. No. 6005. 2052) and once again emphatically expressed for the reasonable, just and lawful exercise of the discretionary power.<br><br>

Lakpa Lama v. HMG, Ministry of Local Development and others, is a landmark decision of the Full Bench919 of the Supreme Court. In this case the petitioner was dismissed from the post of the member-secretary of Gumba Management and Development Committee by the decision of HMG, dated 2055-07-18. The major part of a five-year tenure of the petitioner for that post was still to complete as he was nominated for the member of the said committee on 2055-03-10. Reasonable grounds and reason were not provided to the petitioner as to why he had been removed from the post prior to the completion of the fixed tenure. The Court reasoned that even the discretionary power of a certain authority to add. minimize and change a thing in a particular way should be based on law. It should be exercised by contemplative law, justice and good conscience. The Court observed, if the law itself fixes the tenure of a certain post and a person gets appointment or nomination for such post he/she can be removed from such acquired post prior to the completion of the tenure only in very special circumstance by solid and definite grounds against the performance of his/her responsibilities. The Court referred the provisions decisions like, Ganesh Jha v. The Executive Council, T.U.920 Jeeka Prasad Pokharel v. HMG, Council of Ministers921, Rukm Shamsher v. Secretariat of the Council of Ministers and expressed that the discretionary exercise of power cannot be exercised lightly. The course further stated that the principles propounded by the Court in different cases, as mentioned above have directed certain positive path and taken a certain place in determining the litigation, therefore, it is the Constitutional duty and responsibility of all to follow such pronounced principles. As the petitioner was removed from the post of the member of the Gumba Management and Development Committee without ground and reason, the Court ruled such decision as unlawful and contrive to the

6. 3.5 Public Interest Litigations<br><br>

In Radheshyam Adhikari v. HMG (hereinafter referred to as the Ambassador Appointment Case), the news published by weekly "Matribhumi" quoting a Minister about the appointment of an ambassador by HM the King without advice or recommendation of the Council of Ministers was the issue. The Court took help of Article 35(6) of the Constitution and ruled that it was prohibited to raise any question on matters whether any advice or recommendation has been made to His Majesty, and if so, what advice or recommendation was offered by the Council of Ministers or any authority or official pursuant to this Constitution. Similarly Article 41(2) prohibits raising any question on matters of compliance with HMG Conduct of Business Rules that regulates the procedures in respect of the presentation of advice and recommendation to HM by the Council of Ministers. The Supreme Court held that the right to information is not an absolute right. Article 16 of the Constitution qualifies the right through its proviso, which says that this Article shall not compel any one to provide information on any matter about which secrecy is to be maintained by law. The Court, in this case, clarified that the right to information is subject to the limit imposed by

11 S. Ct. Bull. 10 (2059). 923 NLR 2048 at 810.

403pp


Article 4192 and Article 35(6) of the Constitution Though this case did not give any remedy to the petitioner who demanded information regarding the appointment of an ambassador, it settled some important issues related to the right to information. It rejected the claim for information relating to the privileged communication between His Majesty and King and the Council of Ministers. Similarly, it propounded a doctrine of "meaningful relation" to file public interest litigation. It will be applicable in the right to information cases because most of the cases on the right to information have been filed under the banner of public interest litigation. It is because the right to information is confined to the information that is of public importance.<br><br>

Information that falls outside the ambit of public importance cannot be claimed under Article 16. Thus, there is a good nexus between public interest litigation and the right to information. Given public interest litigation, the Supreme Court minutely analysed the concept of public right or interest,927 The Court held that928 public right or interest indicates, dispute which is not limited to personal right or interest of a certain person or persons. It is related to collective right or interest of all people in general or of any community of people of the Kingdom of Nepal If any person commits certain act in contravention of law and thereby causes some specific injury to a person or persons, such matter relates to the personal right or interest of such person or persons. Contrary to it if anyone, particularly HMG or any public institution or official, does not perform any

Article 41 states (1) The allocation and transaction of business of His Majesty's Government shall be carried out as set forth in rules approved by His Majesty, (2) No question shall be raised in any Court as to whether or not rules made pursuant to clause (1) have been observed.<br><br>

as No question shall be raised in any Court as to whether or not any recommendation or advice has been given to His Majesty pursuant to this Constitution by the Council of Ministers or any other institution or official, nor shall any question be raised in any Court about what recommendation or advice has been given.<br><br>

act required to be performed under the Constitution or any law or performs any act prohibited by the Constitution or the law and as a result thereof causes not a personal injury to any person or persons in the eyes of law but bring adverse effect upon general interest or welfare of the general public, it becomes a matter of public right or interest. It is all-probable that the interest or concern of a certain individual is mixed up or included within the collective right or interest of the general public. But the law does not recognize or protect such collective right or interest in the form of personal right or interest of the individual. The terms public right or interest does not relate the public right and interest to the numerical count of the people.<br><br>

The approach employed by the Supreme Court to determine public or private interest is based on its nature and relationship with public and not on numerical count. This approach of the Supreme Court seems relevant to determine the nature of information, whether it is of public importance or of private importance. It can be judged with the parameter of the Supreme Court's ruling in this case.<br><br>

The notion of locus standi developed by the Supreme Court in Ambassador Appointment Case is applicable in the case relating to the right to information. Even though, information having public importance can be demanded by any citizen, there are some implicit provisions, which should be honoured. Individual citizens cannot have a right to demand information out of curiosity. Public interest cannot be measured only by public nature of the information brought. To constitute public interest the public must have a meaningful relation with the information. The Supreme Court clarified that the dispute involving the right or concern of the public does not involve personal stake and issues of personal right or concern. Public right or interest involves collective right and concern of the people in general.929<br><br>

The Court observed that the petitioner must show that he has a meaningful relation and substantial interest with the controversy that he

929 Ibid.

930 Ibid.

405pp




has presented to the Court as justiciable controversy. He must also assure the Court that he can genuinely represent the people in general with a particular public right or concern. Thus, just a general interest or concern is not enough to prove his standing

The Ambassador Appointment Case is more important for limitations on the right to information. It provides justification for cabinet information. The characteristics of the cabinet form of government where cabinet information needs some sort of confidentiality was examined and held that in the context of cabinet from the government adopted by our Constitution the personal opinion or views of any minister have no Constitutional significance. The Constitution has installed the Council of Ministers as a collective body to be constituted under the leadership of the Prime Minister. The members of the Council of Ministers are collectively responsible to Parliament. Each and every act of the Council of Ministers is presumed to have been made with collective consensus of all ministers and all should collectively bear the responsibility thereof. As such the personal opinion or views of a minister have no value. The member of the Council of Ministers bearing such collective responsibility are not authorised without prior permission of the Prime Minister or of the Council of Ministers, to reveal publicly any opinion or views of oneself or of any ministerial colleague in respect of any act performed or to be performed by the Council of Ministers, nor any fact known by him or informed to him in the meetings of the Council of Ministers or in the context of inter departmental communications. The authority to inform publicly any opinion or decision of the Council of Ministers remains with the Council of Ministers or only with the Prime Minister. If any other minister has to inform publicly the opinion or decision of the Council of Ministers on any subject, either he has to be authorised by the Council of Ministers or he should receive prior permission from the Prime Minister. It is a Constitutional convention that has been endorsed by our Constitution through the provision of oath of office and secrecy as contained in Article

From the observation of B.N. Upadhyaya, CJ, as stated above, this case supplied the nature of cabinet information and its disclosure. It emphasised on collective responsibility of the Council of Ministers regarding cabinet information and made the Prime Minister an authorised person to work on behalf of the Council of Ministers. The Supreme Court left the matter to be decided by the Council of Ministers collectively whether it must divulge any information to the public.<br><br>

The Court further observed that each member of the Council of Ministers is bound by the oath of secrecy subscribed by him during his initiation as a minister to keep such matters in confidence. The duty of a minister to maintain secrecy of the information and records remains intact even after he is relieved from the post. The Court referred to the Constitutional conventions developed in the United Kingdom while deciding this case. The Court cited an example of the United Kingdom where the cabinet form of government originated and flourished. In the United Kingdom the records of the meetings of earlier cabinet are not open even to the present Prime Minister and the existing cabinet without express approval of the then Prime Minister.<br><br>

The Court realised the delicate nature of relationship between the Constitutional monarch and the cabinet and refrained from issuing an order to keep the Constitutional balance alive. It applied the concept of judicial self-restraint in this case. The Ambassador Appointment Case has provided a fresh impetus towards the democratic norms of the confidentiality of the business of the head of the government keeping delicate nature of such relationship in view.<br><br>

Court under its extraordinary jurisdictioni to issue an order to provide information relating to why the decision to chop down the sacred Pipal tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha at Lumbini was taken in addition to translocation of the temple of Mayadevi. The petitioner had contended that the sacred "Pipar tree and Mayadevi temple are important national heritage and destruction of or tampering with these historic resources is tantamount to doing an annihilation of the historic and culturally sensitive assets.<br><br>

In this case the petitioner approached the Court on the basis of news published by two weekly newspapers called "The Rastrapukar" and "The Nepal Jagaran" that published news about the chopping down of the pipal tree associated with the nativity of Lord Buddha. These newspapers raised the issue that the stem and branches of the chopped down pipal tree were being smuggled in the name of Lord Buddha and an enormous amount of money had been illegally collected by the authority of Lumbini Development Fund.<br><br>

In the written statement filed by the respondents in the Supreme Court it was stated that the respondents informed the public regarding such activities from time to time. However, the respondents could not produce any evidence to support this contention. So, the Court did not agree with the plea of the respondents and ordered the respondents to divulge publicly the reasons why the sacred pipal tree needed to be chopped down and idols of Mayadevi temple to be shifted from there. Krishna Jung Rayamajhi, J. held that it was the duty of the agencies concerned to immediately execute flow of information to public in general on the matter of archaeological, religious and historic interests. Not doing this amounts to failing in their duties.934<br><br>

The Supreme Court in this case changed its earlier modus operandi to provide requested information. In this case the Court ordered the respondent to disseminate information to the public by mass media instead of giving it to the petitioner alone. The decision of this case

The petitioner claimed that it was against the provision of Section 58 of the Local Bodies (Election Procedure) Act 1993.<br><br>

Section 26 of the Local Bodies (Election Procedure) Act prescribes that the Election Officer has to declare the person elected unopposed if there is single candidate or all other persons who had filed nomination withdrew their nomination before the prescribed date. The plea of the petitioner was that every voter has the right to know the result of election for which has cast his vote. To narrow down this right is against Article 16 of the Constitution that guarantees the right to receive information.<br><br>

The petitioner also contended that according to the National Broadcasting Act the broadcasters are under obligation to broadcast authentic news and information. The directive issued by the Election Commission was, therefore, against the provision of the National Broadcasting Act. Section 7 of the National Broadcasting Act lays down the circumstances in which valid restriction can be imposed on broadcasting it. As per this Section. only HMG, with notification in Nepal Gazette, has power to restrain broadcasting. The National Broadcasting Act does not provide the Election Commission to restrict such information. Thus, the directive of the Election Commission is also against the provision of the Section 7 of the National Broadcasting Act. It was also stated that the Election Code of Conduct 1996 and other existing Nepalese laws did not allow the Election Commission to do so.<br><br>

in this case, the Division Bench of the Supreme Court took note of the fact that the media, other than the government media had already published the result of the election of local bodies and found no reason to withhold such result from being broadcast by the government owned media. The Court upheld the right of the Nepalese citizens to receive such information under the Constitution and accordingly issued an interim order against the Election Commission for not to implement the disputed directive issued by it.940<br><br>

It informed that it registers political party only for the sake of election of the House of Representatives and not for other purposes<br><br>

The Supreme Court ruled that in a democratic system, the citizen should not be kept in the dark regarding any subject matter of public importance. The Constitution, therefore, ensures the right to have subtle knowledge continuously without any hindrance as to whether the country is duly governed or not or whether the matter of governing process is fair as per the law and recognised ethical values and norms of the society that is essential to run democratic system? In such system the citizen has the right to demand and receive information whereas the public authority or institution has duty to furnish the same. However, the Court in this case did not issue an order against the Election Commission to register the political party for what the petitioner requested.<br><br>

The Court observed that the citizen, who has sought information from any

public body or authority on whom the Constitution or law do not cast any

duty to provide such information, such uncondemned body or authority are

under no obligation to give the information on such matters<br><br>

The Supreme Court did not find any constitutional or legal duty attached to the Election Commission as regards the registration of any political organization or party. Thus, the Court held that if any body files an application in a public body demanding some information on any matter of public importance, which falls under another public body's jurisdiction. the public body bearing a democratic culture or etiquette, may furnish such information to the requester or it may simply show its inability to provide the same. Unless there is Constitutional or legal obligation attached to such body, the Court does not issue an order of mandamus against it..<br><br>

In this case, the Election Commission did not show the proper body where new political parties have to be registered. It is interesting to note that there is no office prescribed by law to register political party other than the one for purpose of election of the House of Representatives It is a matter of great public concerns where the people have to go to register their political party. Currently there is no answer for this. The decision of the Court simply stated that unless there is clear provision in the Constitution regarding the registration of the political parties by the Election Commission the Court couldn't order the Election Commission to do so. In this case, by applying the principle of judicial activiam the Court could have order the government to prescribe proper forum to register the political parties.<br><br>

In this case, the Court also laid down that the Article 88(2) of the Constitution empowers the Court to issue necessary orders to a legal or Constitutional entity commanding the performance of a particular act therein specified and belonging to its legal or Constitutional duty or to direct the restoration of the public rights of which they have been illegally deprived of Where there is no such duty, the Court cannot command it to perform things, which are not within its authority.<br><br>

In Nara Hari Acharya v HMG, Ministry of Law and Parliamentary Affairs & others, the Supreme Court held that the writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court cannot be used to calculate the cost and expenditure involved to price of the text of the Constitution.

Suvarna Pokharel v. HMG, Ministry of Home Affairs and others is a case where the Supreme Court encountered a new issue. In this case the petitioner wanted to know the provisions of the Rules applicable to him. He had been denied the reasons why his service was terminated and under which legal provision it was authorised to do so.

The petitioner was appointed as a permanent Inspector at the National Bureau of Investigation. He was in probation period. In the mean time, he was sacked from his office without informing him of the reasons of his removal. He stated that his office did not give information regarding his removal for which he has right to know.

ruled that the preamble of the Special Service Act 1985 provides that the Act is to maintain security of the kingdom of Nepal and under Section 12 of this Act. HMG is empowered to frame the Rules in order to implement the Act. The Act provides that the Rules made under this Act shall not be published. In presence of such a clear statutory provision aimed at maintaining national security, the petitioner's contention could not sustain. Thus, petition was dismissed.<br><br>

In this case, the Court did not clarify whether someone has the right to information about his removal from his office. Apparently it seems that there must be information and reasons under which the petitioner was sacked. Nevertheless, how could the petitioner be satisfied about his removal if he does not know the reasons. Similarly, an unpublished law does not mean it is completely unknown. People who deal with this law need to know the provision of such law. Moreover, any body that has to obey the law applicable to him requires knowing the law. It is his right to information. In such a situation, the duty of confidentiality is needed to protect national security that also justifies the right to know the law about which he has to be committed forever. Neither the respondents nor the Court took this issue seriously. So far the petitioner's claim regarding information is concerned, it seems to be of private nature. How the private information became of public importance, the petitioner did not clarify this in his petition and the Court also did not take the issue seriously whether the information at issue was of public import or public interest. The Court could have rejected the plea of petitioner on the ground of the nature of information. But it relied on the provision of statute rather than on the

Constitutional interpretation<br><br>

In Mohan Mani Dhaal v. Judicial Council (hereinafter cited as Judges Appointment Case), the Supreme Court once again encountered a new issue. In this case the petitioner, class I gazetted officer of Nepal Judicial Service, was appointed as an additional judge of one of the Appellate Courts of Nepal. He alleged that the Judicial Council while recommending<br><br>

his name as an additional judge to the king, did not consider his seniority and made him junior to some other persons so recommended He also pointed out that he is a permanent employee of HMG How the Judicial Council did recommend him as an additional judge without his approval? Besides, he contended that he did not know the reasons why he was made junior. He approached to the Judicial Council to know the reasons to his appointment and seniority. The Judicial Council did not furnish information to the petitioner. Then the petitioner approached the Supreme Court under Article 16 of the Constitution<br><br>

The Judicial Council in written statement stated that the petitioner has no locus standi to demand information on the ground of Article 16 of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal because the Article does not compel the Council to divulge the information, which has to be kept secret by law. It also said that the matter of his appointment is private matter and not a matter of public importance. Likewise in its written statement, the Council raised the issue of locus standi stating that the petitioner did not join his office as an additional judge within a prescribed time. If someone so appointed fails, without any genuine cause, to join his office within a period of one month from the date of his appointment, he ceases to be a judge. On this ground, he is no more a judge, hence no locus standi Similarly, the defendant raised the issue that judgeship is an appointment and not a promotion. In an appointment there are criteria fixed by law to be considered before such appointment takes place. Therefore, the concept of seniority does not apply in such appointment. Also, that the petitioner did not make the persons alleged to be juniors as defendants in the case. The Supreme Court held that: The appointment of the judges of the Court of Appeal is to be made by His Majesty the King on the recommendation of the Judicial Council as per Article 90[1] of the Constitution of the Kingdom of Nepal. Article 35(6) of the Constitution forbids raising questions regarding such recommendations made by the Judicial Council. Information about such recommendation is also

417pp


protected under the saving clause of the Article 16. Judicial Council is established in accordance with the provision of the Constitution. However, this Court has power of Judicial Review of the public notice published in Nepal gazette thereby checking the Constitutionality of the recommendation of the judicial council.<br><br>

To support this right of judicial review the Court cited the Ambassador Appointment case and House Dissolution cases. The Court established that the appointment of a judge is not to be made only on the basis of seniority but it is to be made in view of seniority, experience, knowledge of subject matter, performance, honesty, impartiality and moral conduct. Section 4(1) of the Judicial Council Act has made mandatory provision that the Judicial Council has to record the reasons and basis while recommending for the appointment of a person in a judgeship. If the petitioner thinks that persons having no qualification prescribed by the Article 90(1) of the Constitution of Kingdom of Nepal 1990, have been appointed as the judges of the Court of Appeal which violates his right, he has Constitutional right to approach the Supreme Court invoking extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 23, 88(1) and 88(2) of the Constitution. But in this case it is not so. The petitioner has prayed to issue an order of mandamus under Article 16 of the Constitution to provide him information regarding his appointment. In this case, question regarding the appointment of unqualified person has not been raised. Therefore the Court dismissed the writ petition.<br><br>

The Supreme Court did not speak about what amounts the information of public importance. Neither had it decided the issue raised by judicial council in its written statement. The Judicial Council argued the matter as a private interest. Similarly, in this case there was situation to decide about whether right to information provides right to know the facts or even interpretation made by the Constitutional body on the basis of facts. If someone was considered unfit to be appointed as a judge from the collected information and analysis of such information, how can he is entitled to have such information? It is the internal information and impression, which cannot be given to him.<br><br>

418pp


The Court even did not consider the propriety of such information Nobody has the right against the government to say that he must be appointed to a particular post. Similarly, it is the matter of recommending body to consider the appropriateness of a particular person in a particular position. Though the government must be accountable while acting under the Constitution, it should make reasonable decision. It should act without fear and favour while appointing a Judge. It is not the business of the judiciary to go into details of such work, which cannot be judicially settled.<br><br>

In this petition the petitioner was appointed as a judge of Appellate Court and was not promoted. It is a political process rather than legal process. In an appointment the Judicial Council has to function as per the Constitution and the law. If the law does not prohibit such appointment the question raised by the petitioner may not have relevance.<br><br>

In Jhanka Kadel v. P.M. Girija Prasad Koirali the petitioner had demanded information with the government regarding the property of the late king Birendra. The Government did not give him the information the petitioner demanded. Then the petitioner went to the Supreme Court for the registration of a writ petition against the Prime Minister. Registrar of the Supreme Court denied registering the writ petition on the ground that the matter of the writ petition was related with the Article 31 of the Constitution, which could not be judicially settled. Afterwards the petitioner registered an application against the denial of such a registration of the writ petition. In this writ petition the Supreme Court single bench upheld the order of the Supreme Court Registrar stating that the matter connected with the private property of the late king is concerned with other member of royal family and royal palace. The bench therefore held that the Article 31 of the Constitution can be applied.<br><br>

From the decision of the Supreme Court one can infer that the property belonging to the king and royal family is not the matter of public importance in relation to the Article 16 of the Constitution. Because of

4 S. Ct. Bull. 21-22(2058)

419pp


this, no citizen has right to demand information regarding the property of the king.<br><br>

In Lauda Air Casess the petitioners demanded information from RNAC regarding the agreement formalized between RNAC and the Lauda Air RNAC did not provide information to the petitioners regarding the agreement. Therefore the petitioners approached the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court in this case rejected the contention of the petitioners stating that the petitioners have not been able to show their meaningful relation with the subject matter. Likewise the Court also held that the right to information is available against the activities and actions of the state. It cannot be available against RNAC like autonomous corporation established with a commercial motive.<br><br>

The logic applied by the Supreme Court does not fit with the concept of state these days. All the countries of the world use their writ jurisdiction against public corporations having majority share of the government. In this case RNAC is Government Corporation run by taxpayer's money. The logic given by the Supreme Court in this case cannot be justified on the conceptual basis. Earlier practice also shows that the Supreme Court of Nepal has frequently used its writ jurisdiction against public enterprises run by the government. This case proves that instead of going forward we are going back so far the concept of state and protection of the fundamental rights is concerned<br><br>

The Supreme Court of Nepal has recognised the right to information as a basis of democratic ideal and values. It perceives the right to information as the cornerstone of democratic administrative system.<br><br>

The Supreme Court has decided that the activities of the government that affect the whole nation or any group or community of the public directly or indirectly are of public importance. The Constitution provides the right to demand and receive information in the matter of public importance. There

is no law to define what the matter of public importance is. The Supreme Court filled the gap. The Court in Tanakpur Case made it clear that a matter of public importance need not affect the whole country if it affects certain group or community; it suffices to be a matter of public importance. The Court found that the matter contained in a bilateral agreement regarding water resources is of public importance. The Court in Ambassador Appointment Case clarified that the correspondences exchanged between the Council of Ministers and the King are privileged The Court propounded a theory of meaningful relation in this case. It narrowed down the concept of locus standi in relation to demanding information from the government. Though every citizen is entitled to demand information, there must be meaningful relation to demand the information. Similarly, in Arun III Case, the Court filled the gap, which existed in the Nepalese law. There was no fixed procedure for applying for information, how to give information, about payments for obtaining information etc. The Supreme Court seized the opportunity in this case and gave eight point guidelines to the government. The guidelines are as good as right to information legislation until the government enacts separate legislation to this effect. The Supreme Court found very close relationship between the matters of public interest and the matters of public importance. In some cases the Supreme Court ordered the government to publish information publicly instead of giving it only to the requester. In this respect, it favoured active publicity rather than the passive publicity. If the government suo motto publishes the information having public interest there is no need of demanding information. In view of this, the Supreme Court in Lumbini Case changed its focus towards the active publicity.<br><br>

The Supreme Court did not only explain the matters to be published for the public, it also recognised the nature of cabinet secret. It accepted that the right to information does not allow knowing information regarding the cabinet. The Court in Purendra Aryal Case clearly pronounced that unless there is Constitutional or legal obligation attached to public body to

421pp


provide information the Court does not issue an order of manilamus against any public body to provide information<br><br>

The Supreme Court has also propounded a precedent that any information having national concern is a matter of right to information and the government or public authority has to inform the people about such matter. Keeping the need of the hour in mind, the Court in Godavari Marble Case held that a matter related to environment protection is very serious, sensitive and important from the humanistic, national and international perspectives and is thus a matter of public importance. As a matter of public importance there is the right to information<br><br>

The right to information cannot be meaningfully implemented without enacting separate legislation dealing with the right to information because the effort made by the Supreme Court cannot address overall issues and problems of the right.<br><br>

CHAPTER SEVEN SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

7.1 General Overview

The system of judicial review is an indispensable instrument to protect and promote the basic rights of the individual against any undue encroachment of the government, namely, the legislature and the executive. It is an essential component of a limited government. It is directed against legislation or any executive action which is inconsistent with the fundamental law of the land. In a judicial system, judicial review is required in order to play few prominent functions; they include: to legitimate the government action; to protect the Constitution against any undue encroachment by the government; and to protect the people from government tyranny 956<br><br>

Broadly speaking, the purpose of judicial review is to prevent authorities exceeding their jurisdiction: to compel them to exercise the jurisdiction which is rightfully theirs, and to control the way they exercise that jurisdiction in the sense of correcting fundamental irregularities in their procedures.<br><br>

Under the system of judicial review, every state action whether it be of the

legislature or of the executive or of an administrative authority that does

not comply with the requirement of reasonableness or is of the

arbitrariness is struck down by the judiciary. Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service classified three well established heads or sets of circumstances in which the Court will interfere. First, illegality 57, secondly, irrationality; and thirdly, procedural impropriety, Those three heads are not exhaustive. Nor are they necessarily mutually exclusive 960<br><br>

Judicial review is thus an integral part of the Constitution as without it dispensation of social justice as well as trinity of social justice- justice, equality and liberty- is a mere myth, and as such it being a basic structure of the Constitution cannot be abolished or abridged or taken away or whittled down even by an amendment of the Constitution. The institution of judicial review is predicated upon the existence of a written Constitution that is changeable only by some extraordinary process of legislation or referendum. The Supreme Court has observed that judicial review is the soul of the system in constitutional democracy wedded to the rule of law 902 The trend marked by the modern judiciary has further called upon the need of judicial review even in new democracies. The role played by the Indian and American judiciary, in particular, in the area of judicial activism so as to protect and promote the basic rights of individual and basic needs of the society by exercising judicial review as a tool to achieve the goal is the instance of it. The judiciary in Nepal also has

By procedural impropriety, he meant the failure to observe basic rules of natural justice or failure to act with procedural fairness towards the person who will be affected by the decision. (ibid)

marked, in some cases, such instances of the success of the system of judicial review.<br><br>

The jurisprudential value of judicial review is not ipse dixit but functional and inherent as well as ingrained in the constitutional ethos. It is a basic principle of the rule of law that the exercise of power by the executive or any administrative authority must also be in accordance with law and the power of judicial review is conferred by the Constitution with a view to ensuring that the law is observed and there is compliance with the requirement of law on the part of executive and other authorities; it is through the power of judicial review conferred on an independent Court that the rule of law is maintained and every organ of the state is kept within the limits of the law.963<br><br>

In the field of administrative law, judicial review is of great importance, being used to control the way in which a wide variety of tribunals and other persons under a duty to act judicially, administratively, and quasi judicially exercise their powers. In administrative law it is believed that judicial review provides adequate safeguards against arbitrariness and the whole superstructure of control mechanism is built on the foundation of the system of judicial review 96 The core of the system of judicial review in administrative law is that it concerns with the legitimacy of administrative process rather than the legitimacy of administrative action. Most people agree that the nature and purpose of judicial review is the review of decision making process but not the review of decision of the administrative authority.965 In this connection, judicial review is not concerned with the decision but with the decision making process because in the exercise of power of judicial review the Courts are concerned with the legality of procedure followed and not with the validity of the order.<br><br>

Another remarkable point to make here is that judicial review is not an appeal process; as aforesaid in judicial review the Court is basically concerned with the decision-making process of the administration

We understand that if the Constitution is held to be a higher law, then the logic demands that a law which conflicts with a provision in the Constitution be not applied. Nevertheless, justifications for judicial review of legislation other than that of logical necessity were put forward, in particular by way of response to the familiar argument that judicial review of legislation is anti-majoritarian or anti-democratic 967 It was observed, for example, that democracy itself demands more than simply that the will of the majority shall prevail; it demands also that the interests of minorities and of individuals should be respected, at least to the extent that those interests are recognized in the Constitution, and to that end judicial review may be essential. Again, as was also observed, the fact that non democratic governments which have come to power following a coup detat or other violent means almost invariably suppress the institution of judicial review suggests that the institution protects rather than defeats the ideals of democracy.<br><br>

The term judicial review is commonly used to describe all forms of judicial scrutiny. But the usage may blind us to the variety of possible judicial functions with relation to official activity and may even lead to false conclusions. A statute, for example, may expressly or by implication provide that an administrative determination shall be final and not be reversed or re-determined by any Court or agency." 968<br><br>

The constitutional draftsmen, in the latter days, have tried to sketch a living Constitution- a Constitution that is in actual work and p power.

However, there is a great difficulty to do so. The difficulty is that the object is in constant change. It is in that circumstance the system of judicial review becomes only the resort to make the Constitution really a living

7.2 The Practice<br><br>

As a constitutional practice, judicial review is usually considered to have begun with the assertion by John Marshall, Chief Justice of the United States, in Marbury v. Madison in 1803, of the power of the Supreme Court to invalidate legislation enacted by Congress. The Supreme Court of the USA through this case first claimed that it had the power to review legislative decisions against constitutional standards. The Court argued that since the Constitution provides that the Constitution shall be the supreme law of the land, the Courts in general, and the Supreme Court in the end, must have power to declare statutes void that offend that Constitution.<br><br>

There was, in fact, no express warrant for Marshall's assertion of the power of judicial review in the actual text of the Constitution, although there was some precedent for it in the British Privy Council review of colonial legislation; its success rested ultimately on the Supreme Court's own ruling, plus the absence of effective political challenge to it.<br><br>

Marshall John born Sept. 24, 1755, near Germantown, Va. died July 6, 1835, Philadelphia fourth chief justice of the United States andprincipal founder of the US system of Constitutional law, including the doctrine of judicial review. The first of Marshall's greatcases in more than 30 years of service was Marbury Madison (1803), which established the Supreme Court's right to state and expound Constitutional law His most important decision in exercising this authority was in McCulloch v Maryland (1819), which upheld the authority of Congress to create the Bank of the United States. During his tenure Marshall participated in more than 1,000 decisions, writing $19 of them himself

A number of the Constitutions drafted in Europe and Asia after World War Il incorporated judicial review in various forms: in France, where the Cour de Cassation, the Supreme Court, has no power of judicial review, a constitutional committee of mixed judicial-legislative character was established; Germany and Italy provided more directly for Special Constitutional Courts; Japan, India, and Pakistan set up Supreme Courts exercising judicial review on the general United States and British Commonwealth pattern.<br><br>

Widespread pressures after World War II for the adoption of judicial review stemmed from the feeling, strongly influenced by U.S. Constitutional ideas, that a system of constitutional checks and balances is an essential condition of a democratic government. Some observers concluded that the concentration of government power in the executive, substantially unchecked by other agencies of government, contributed to the rise of totalitarian regimes in Germany and Japan in the era between World War I and World War II.<br><br>

The experience of judicial review in some other countries has shown a tendency to favour economic and property interests, accompanied by a firm insistence that the judges task is one of interpretation alone. Germany, on the other hand, has adopted the judicial activism of its American model.<br><br>

7.3 The System<br><br>

The system of judicial review principally rests with three aspects of the phenomenon: (1) the organs in which the power of judicial review resides, (2) the procedures by which questions of constitutionality are resolved. and (3) the effects of a finding of unconstitutionality on the law under review and on the specific case (if there be one) that give rise to the constitutional question.

428pp



The organ or organs that are empowered to judge the constitutionality of laws may be a nation's regular Courts or a specially created Constitutional Court. In the American system the regular Courts perform this function. and in this respect the American practice has been followed in Switzerland, Norway, and Denmark, as well as in such non-European countries as Australia, Canada, India and Japan etc. With the exception of Switzerland, however, judicial review has played a relatively minor role in the constitutional history of the European countries noted.<br><br>

The reasons for relying on the regular Courts for judicial review are quite convincing. All judges must apply the law to the case at hand. When there are contrasting laws that appear applicable the judge must decide which should prevail. There are tradition criteria for this. When there is a written Constitution that cannot be amended by ordinary legislation, there is created a hierarchy of law, and just as prevails over an ordinary law: lex superior derogate legi inferion. According to this reasoning, when the Courts declare a law incompatible with a provision in the Constitution, they are merely performing their normal and fundamental judicial function of applying the law.<br><br>

In Europe, Austria took such a course of action for the first time in 1920 and since the end of the Second World War, Italy, Germany, Turkey, Cyprus, and Yugoslavia have followed suit. It appears that one reason for this development is the fundamental incompatible that exists between the American system of judicial review and the legal system based on Roman law. Under the Anglo-American doctrine of stare decisis, a decision by the highest Court in any jurisdiction is binding on all lower Courts in the same jurisdiction, and thus as soon as that Court has declared a law unconstitutional, no other Court can apply it. The Court does not need a specific grant of the power to declare a law invalid, nor must it decide anything beyond the applicability of the law in question to the concrete case. Thus, although the unconstitutional statute may remain on the books, it is a 'dead law'. Stare decisis, however, is not normally part of the

429pp




Roman law systems, and thus in these systems the Courts are not generally bound even by the decisions of the highest Court. Under these circumstances the American system of judicial review can lead to grave uncertainty and confusion, as one Court may decide to enforce a statute that another Court will find invalid.<br><br>

In a situation, the Nepalese system of judicial review also needs to be modified and reformed. We need to establish a Special Constitutional Court like in the most of Europeans outside of the regular judicial system. The question may then arise as to why it was suggested to create a special Court for this purpose in the absence of a rule of stare decisis, rather than to follow the American example. The reasons behind this are that judicial review is more a legislative than a judicial function. For an instance, Hans Kelsen in Austria and Piero Calamandrei in Italy, two eminent jurists who instrumental in setting up the constitutional Courts of their countries, were also influenced by this belief. 970 Another reason, at least in the context of Nepal, may be the desire of the constitutional assembly to create a new high-ranking and prestigious organ upon which the power of control over government could be provided. Similarly, the rules of separation of powers will also be upheld.<br><br>

There is also a contrast between the procedures used in the American and European systems of judicial review. The Anglo-American legal tradition is allergic to adjudication of matters of general principle. The constitutionality of a law is not considered a justiciable question unless it is directly involved in a specific conflict. Thus, the constitutionality of a statute is usually not the sole issue in a case; rather, it arises as a question that must be answered before getting down to deciding the specific conflict at hand. This incidental nature of judicial review is common to all the countries that follow the American system. In a certain

number of jurisdictions, however (Canada, Norway and at least ten of the fifty states that form the United States), the highest Courts are also permitted by Constitution, statute or convention to render advisory opinions on Constitutional question at the request of other government organs.<br><br>

The effect of a finding of unconstitutionality on the law under review and on the specific case is another aspect of judicial review. The different effect, in the first place, rests on the prevalence of the rules of stare decisis. The effect also rests on the force of declaring the law unconstitutional. For example, in the American system of judicial review, a decision in which the law is compared with the Constitution and declared to be either compatible or incompatible with it. If incompatible, the law is sought never to have been valid, therefore the Court does not annul it, since in theory the law has been invalid. However, under the European system, in particular the Austria system, the unconstitutional law is considered annullable rather than null, and the Court after having ascertained its incompatibility with the Constitution expressly annuls it The unconstitutional law considered valid until the Court annuls it. In exceptional cases, the Court may even postpone the annulment of an unconstitutional law for a period of up to a year, the Turkish Court can do this for six months.972<br><br>

The proposition with regard to first aspect of effectiveness that decisions on the Constitutionality or otherwise of a law should have effect erga omnes if the institution of judicial review is to be regarded as effective.

So far as the second aspect of the effectiveness of judicial review is concerned, this is difficult to assess; clearly it cannot simply be measured by reference to the number of laws struck down, a statistic which varies greatly from one country to anther. However, it was emphasized in

37 THE AUSTRIAN CONSTITUTION art. 140. THE TURKISH CONSTITUTION art. 152

431pp




particular that judicial review cannot be effective without judges who are genuinely independent not only in the sense that their individual decisions are not directly influenced or controlled by the political branches of government but also in the sense that their education and professional experience shall have equipped them with true intellectual independence.<br><br>

In addition to these basic aspects of the subject, a number of other topics received attention, in particular that type of judicial control of legislation that may be exercised covertly in the guise of statutory interpretation.<br><br>

7.4 The Model<br><br>

Broadly speaking judicial review conforms, to date, to one of two models, the Austrian and the American. Under the former, questions of the constitutionality of legislation can be decided only by a special constitutional Court on reference from an authorized person who may or may not be a judge before whom such a question is raised in the course of ordinary litigation, and the review may be a priori or posteriori.<br><br>

Under the latter, it is the duty of any judge before whom such a question is raised in the course of (extra-ordinary) litigation to deal with it there and then, although, no doubt, in important cases the question will finally be decided by the Supreme Court; review of this kind is necessarily a posteriori. The French system can, perhaps, be regarded as a particular version of the Austrian Model, for the Conseil Constitutionnel alone has power to pronounce a parliamentary law unconstitutional and then only on the reference of specified persons; the challenged law is referred to the onseil before promulgation, and no law or part of law declared to be unconstitutional may be promulgated.973<br><br>

It is typical of the Austrian model that the decisions of the constitutional Court have effect erga omnes. Under the American model, by contrast, the

3 Glendon et al, op. cit., at 71,

432pp




decision, even if of the Supreme Court, is binding as res judicata only between the parties. In countries of the common law tradition this is not a serious disadvantage because the doctrine stare decisis has the result that the decision that a law is unconstitutional will almost invariably be applied thereafter, but elsewhere as, for example, in some countries of Latin-America where the American model has been followed, such a decision will be disregarded by other Courts and the administration alike On the whole, therefore, the American model is seen as unsuitable for countries of the civil law tradition 974<br><br>

7.4.1 Cases of Nepal<br><br>

Nepal so far is concerned, adopts something new model to that of Austrian and American ones where a question is raised in the course of extra ordinary litigation to deal with it by the Supreme Court on any one of the following grounds: to have any law or any part thereof declared void on the ground of inconsistency with the constitution because it imposes an unreasonable restrictions of the enjoyment of fundamental rights conferred on by the constitution; to have the enforcement of fundamental rights or any other legal rights for which no other remedy has been provided; or have demand for the settlement of any constitutional or legal question involved in any dispute of public interest or concern.<br><br>

Our Constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of legislation as well as of administrative action so as to secure its conformity with the Constitution. The framers of our Constitution have, by virtue of Art. 88 of the 1990 Constitution and Art. 107 of the Interim Constitution of 2007 vested the exclusive power of judicial review in the judiciary. The judiciary with this power can examine the constitutionality of a legislative Act and administrative action and declare null and void to the extent that the Act or action is contrary to the Constitution. This is the system of

Ibid.

433pp





judicial review of legislation and of administrative action ensured by the Constitution<br><br>

Currently, Article 107 is the sole device and soul of judicial review of legislation and of administrative action. It invests the Supreme Court of Nepal with the power of superintendence over legislature, administrative agencies\bodies authorities\tribunals quasi-judicial bodies exercising ad judicatory powers. The nature and ambit of this power is both administrative (i.e. superintendence jurisdiction) and judicial (Le judicial review). The court shall exercise this power in a wide scale, for example;<br><br>

. To prevent grave miscarriage of justice,<br><br>

• To prevent flagrant violation of law;<br><br>

To prevent violation of jurisdiction, namely, lack of

jurisdiction, excess of jurisdiction, abuse of jurisdiction:<br><br>

To prevent violation of the principles of natural justice<br><br>

To prevent error of law apparent on the face of record and so

Looking at the number of suits brought against legislature and executive. in almost every respect judicial review seems to play a more prominent, effective as well as efficient role in Nepal. People feel safe at the hands of the judiciary in getting redress to their grievances not because the Constitution provides judicial review against legislative acts and administrative actions, but on account of the fact of the independence of Judiciary which looks into the fairness of procedures followed.<br><br>

In order to determine whether a right is abridged or infringed it is first necessary to determine the extent of the right given by the articles and the limitations prescribed in the articles themselves permitting its curtailment. The inclusion of article I in the Constitution appears to be a matter of abundant caution. Even in its absence, if any of the fundamental rights was infringed by any legislative enactment, the Court

434pp




has always the power to declare the enactment; to the extent it transgresses the limits, invalid. The existence of article in the Constitution, therefore, is not material for the decision of the question what fundamental right is given and to what extent it is permitted to be abridged by the Constitution<br><br>

The Constitution of Nepal has made a compromise between parliamentary sovereignty and a written Constitution with a provision for judicial review, which is very much unique as compared to Constitutions of other countries. An absolute balance of powers between the different organs of government is an impracticable thing and, in practice, the final say must belong to some one of them. This is why it is the judiciary in Nepal which has final say with regard to interpretation of the law and Constitution. And, this duty is performed by the Court through the power of judicial review.<br><br>

Articles 32 and 107 do not merely confer power on the Supreme Court, to issue certain writs for the enforcement of the rights conferred by part III or for any other purpose, as part of its general jurisdiction. Article 32 provides a guaranteed remedy for the enforcement of those rights, and this remedial right is itself made a fundamental right by being included in part III. The Supreme Court is thus constituted the protector and guarantor of fundamental rights, and it cannot, consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it, refuse to entertain applications seeking protection against infringements of such rights. Thus the remedial right given to the citizen to move the Supreme Court by a petition under article 88 and to claim an appropriate writ against any Constitutional infringement of fundamental right is itself a guaranteed fundamental right.<br><br>

The system of judicial review ensued by the Constitution seems to have been much advanced and progressive to that of other countries Constitution as the Constitution by incorporating this system has at a time also enumerated the system of public interest litigation. It has left

unlimited grounds of locus stand According to this provision, any Nepali citizen can file the writ petition in the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the statutory provision on the ground that it has violated the fundamental rights that are conferred by the Constitution or it has violated any other provision of the Constitution.<br><br>

The extensive power and responsibility given to the judiciary by the Constitution have made the Court of Nepal more reliable and accountable as compared to other co-ordinate branches of government. It sounds that judiciary has been placed in a respective position as presuming it as a protector and guardian of the fundamental right, the Constitution and of the whole mechanism of the state. Thus, the role of judiciary is very much higher and serious. The state may face a great crisis and people may also have a great sufferer if the judiciary becomes incapable of performing its Constitutional duties and obligations,<br><br>

With the promulgation of the 1990 Constitution, the experience of more than a decade has been witnessed. In the tenure of time, a hundreds of issues have been approached before the Courts under the system of judicial review. A number of legislations have been declared ultra-uires the Constitution and in the same number has the executive action been invalidated. The role of Court has helped to some extent the ordinary people to be acquainted and conscious with their Constitutional and legal rights in the course of delivering justice. Not only that it has also helped Constitutional and legal authority to know their Constitutional limits and act and conduct within the framework of the Constitution<br><br>

In Nepal the Constitution imposes no limits on the powers conferred under Articles 23 and 88 of the previous Constitution and Articles 32 and 107 of the present Constitution and neither on principle nor on authority, would the Supreme Court be justified in dismissing a petition in liming

In spite of all these efforts made by the judiciary in the area of judicial review, a concrete jurisprudence is yet to be materialized. The people are still suffering from the exploitation and suppression of the state. Though the judiciary is independent in a book, the same has yet to be translated into a practice. There are numbers of confusions and ambiguities reflected in the area of judicial review. The problems arisen, with the system of judicial review revolving every where

7.5 The Debates on Judicial Review<br><br>

The study has revealed that there are numbers of debates and issues on the legitimacy and functioning of the system of judicial review which are yet to be addressed and responded. Some of the reactions in this regard can be presented as follows:<br><br>

5.1 Whether judicial review is a foolproof to combat the arbitrary. unreasonableness, illegal, biased, non- reasoned, incompatible administrative actions is a debatable question which has been attracting the attention of all sane thinking persons all over the globe in order to systematize the administrative law. To streamline the notion of judicial review in the arena of administrative law the institution of ombudsman is coming up to cleansing the administration from varied ills Can ombudsman be a substitute for judicial review in monitoring the administrative process has been a question often rose, and as such needs as in-depth probing?<br><br>

5.2 There is also a debate that whether judicial review in constitutional democracies a saint or sinner? It may be sinner for those who are undemocratic and non- believer in constitutional culture, constitutional morality as well as constitutional democracy. It is saint for those who believe that maintenance of the judicial power is essential and indispensable to the very being of government. The Constitution without it would be no Constitution; the government no government.<br><br>

437pp




5.3 In the early days in the UK, the system of judicial review was thought unfit by temperament, equipment, and resources to the function of control, a distortion of effective patterns of and unnecessary for the protection of governed. But in these latter days people have rushed to the defense and reinvestigation of judicial review. In every state today judicial review has been a necessary condition of government. The guarantee of legality by an organ independent of the executive is one of the profoundest, most pervasive premises of any system of government.<br><br>

5.4 Good public servants must be devoted to the law. They have to do with the spirit in which judicial review should be exercised but not with the question whether there shall be review. It is clear that the country looks, and looks with good reason, not to the agencies, but to the Courts for its ultimate protection against executive abuse.976<br><br>

5.5 The need for judicial protection has undoubtedly varied, and the risks of judicial sabotage under the guise of protection are considerable. But we are dealing with basic institutions and basic attitudes; we must take the bad with the good, the fortuitous with the exigent, and the trivial with the necessary. We are dealing here not with what might be, but with what are in fact, the psychological assumptions which sustain cohesion and security 977<br><br>

5.6 Judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation is not accepted in a number of other countries (for example, France). Unconstitutional legislation may consequently be deemed to be valid for the purposes of application and enforcement in the Courts. The only remedy against this usurpation of legislative power will be political

5.7 The question how to bring the balance between the very delicate issues the need to protect individuals and minorities from the majority and the commitment to government by elected representatives has ever been a disputable in the study of judicial review. How are both of these political concerns of modern republics to be accommodated, while preserving the legitimacy of the judicial power, is the dire concern of the day. The experience of the United Kingdom indicates that judicial review of legislation is not essential to the functioning of a democratic political system. In fact, judicial review is, in a sense, anti-democratic because it permits the Courts to be used as means for continuing political battles which have been lost in the elected legislature and possibly to reverse majoritarian outcomes. Nevertheless, most nations have deemed it desirable to institutionalize some form of check on the power of the majority.<br><br>

5.8 Judicial review is frequently resented because both the legislature and the executive assert that vital questions of public policy ought to be determined not in the cloistered atmosphere of the Supreme Court but on the floors of Parliament. This criticism is mostly based on the experience of the working of the American Constitution. Wide and ambiguous phrase like due process have often tempted the Court there to arrogate to itself a position of rivalry with the legislature<br><br>

5.9 Of the all judicial review is not an effective instrument of supervision and control. Redford was of the opinion that- judicial review is too occasional and cursory, and is exercised from too remote a point, to supply an adequate corrective for arbitrary administration of economic controls. Moreover, unless applied only at the periphery it runs counter to the basic idea of delegation of responsibility to administrative agents<br><br>

These words contain a great measure of truth but they are net an argument against judicial review. We must admit that within the area of validity there is great room for corruption fee, inefficiency and irresponsibility. The Courts may correct such laps. But they are on the whole incapable of providing a constant check to had administration or a positive spur to creative administration. The objectives of a good administration must be achieved primarily within the organization itsel However it is in no way inconsistent with the significant role allotted to the Courts.<br><br>

5.10 Problems of legitimacy on judicial review Few questions are being raised as regards to the effectiveness and legitimacy of the system of judicial control. In a particular, first, there is a question of the effectiveness within a legal system of decisions which actually condemns law as unconstitutional (effectiveness of decisions-1) and, secondly, there is the question of the extent to which, in a given system, the institution of judicial review can operate effectively to control infringements of the Constitution by the legislative branch of government (effectiveness effective operation of the institution of judicial revit as such 2)<br><br>

After all, almost all over the countries the views are held that the period of history in which the institution of judicial review itself requires justification is over and that effort should now be devoted rather to its preservation against hostile governments and to improvements in its practical operation<br><br>

7.6 The Interpretation<br><br>

The way of interpreting the Constitution or looking after the Constitution keeps vital concern in judicial review. There are at least two schools of thoughts of constitutional interpretation. On the one side stand the so

440pp





called interpretivists or originalists, those people who hold that the Constitution must be interpreted according to the framers' or ratifiers original content. On the other side stand their antagonists, the noninterpretivists or nonoriginalists, those who believe that constitutional meaning brings upon changing social values.<br><br>

A Court interpreting a Constitution will often encounter vague language and abstract principles whose application in a particular case is uncertain. The hermeneutic it must then engage in is not markedly different from what Courts do when dealing with general concepts in other areas of law. Once case law accumulates and endows concrete content upon general Constitutional norms, it serves as a guide to parties and Courts in the future. How a Court then deals with the body of Constitutional case law may raise problems of legitimacy.<br><br>

The Court should apply liberal as well as dynamic interpretation. So far as the scope of interpretation is concerned, it depends on the nature of a Constitution. In case a Constitution is a brief document like in the Constitution of USA, its wording is very general and naturally the need for adapting it to the rapidly changing conditions is great and that affords the judiciary ample opportunities to play a dominant role wielding its power of interpretation. But in case the Constitution is too detailed one, it, to some extent, limits the scope of interpretation<br><br>

Repeatedly the Courts in India and USA have refused to impose a limitation on the powers of the legislature under the notion of having discovered something in the spirit of the Constitution which is not to be found in the instrument unless the fundamental law curbs the general powers conferred on the legislature, either expressly or by necessary implication, the Courts cannot limit the omnipotence of legislative authority by judicial interpretation 981<br><br>

Chatterjee, op cit., at 45.

441pp





Judicial review, not being an appeal from a decision, but a review of the manner in which the decision is arrived at, the Court while exercising the power of judicial review must remain conscious of the fact that if the decision has been arrived at by the administrative authority after following the principles established by law and the rules of natural justice and the individual has received a fair treatment to meet the case against him, the Court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the administrative authority on a matter which well squarely within the sphere of jurisdiction of that authority 982<br><br>

From the United States came the first examples of written, rigid Constitutions. The United States gave the world another institution that has become a fundamental feature of many contemporary Constitutional systems: judicial review.<br><br>

Under rigid Constitutions it is possible to have special state agencies control the conformity of ordinary legislation with the rules of the Constitution and, in case of conflict, set the former aside. Under a flexible Constitution this cannot happen; in Great Britain, statutes, even if contrary to long-established Constitutional principles, are binding for everybody and can be set aside only by subsequent statutes repealing them. The power to invalidate legislation conflicting with the provisions of a rigid Constitution can be entrusted either to some particular political organ of the state or to the judiciary. A political organ endowed with such power was, for example, the Senate (Sénat Conservateur) under the French Constitutions of 1799 and of 1852. Although some precedents existed in the Constitutional history of other countries, it was in the United States that the idea of making the judiciary the guardian of the Constitution first took definitive shape. Judicial review-the power of Courts to rule on the Constitutional validity of legislation-has the advantage over political review in securing more impartial judgments,<br><br>

supported by reasons articulated according to traditional, tested rules of legal interpretation.

Every enumerated power must be interpreted to promote the purposes stated in the preamble. If a power is expressed or implied in the Constitution, or exists as an attribute of national sovereignty, its exercise does not depend in the slightest degree upon the attitude the founders would have taken toward some particular use of it, or, theoretically, upon the attitude of judges toward that use

7.7 The Observation<br><br>

7.7.1 Constitution<br><br>

Arts, 32 and 107 of the Constitution, which are only the basis of judicial review of legislation and administrative actions, envisages that any Nepali citizen can file a petition in the Supreme Court to have any law or any part thereof declared void on the ground of inconsistency with the Constitution because it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution or any other ground that the law is inconsistent with the Constitution. According to this provision a person can move to the Court of law for seeking order to declare the law null and void if he satisfies the following conditions:<br><br>

A Nepali citizen;<br><br>

The law is inconsistent with the Constitution since it imposes

the unreasonable restriction on the enjoyment of guaranteed

fundamental rights;<br><br> and The law is inconsistent with the Constitution on any ground.

IRVING BRANT, STORM OVER THE CONSTITUTION 125, the Bobbs- Merrill Company Inc (1963)<br><br>

443pp




These provisions show that any person (who is Nepali) can move to the Court for seeking the order to declare any law or there part null and void on the ground that the same is inconsistent with the Constitution on his her personal satisfaction. The Constitution does not require any more objective grounds or experiment of such law before challenge it before the court of law. The process of challenging the constitutionality of law before its real experiment (use enforcement) is considered as an anti-democratic process. In our situation, the time has come to develop some precise guidelines of the handle of judicial review of legislation in particular<br><br>

It is fact that the Court derives the power of judicial review from not any other source but the Constitution. So, the doctrine of judicial review applies only outside the Constitution. The Court cannot judge the constitutionality of the Constitution itself. Such problem has been settled in Indian context. But in Nepal since such question is not arisen till in the Court the issue is yet to be resolved.<br><br>

The Constitution has incorporated the list of fundamental rights under Article 12 to 32 of the Constitution. However, the list of fundamental rights cannot be claimed to be exhaustive. There are many inalienable and fundamental rights, which have not been incorporated in part three of the Constitution. For an instance, marriage is the most intimate natural right of a man and a woman. It has not been inserted in the Constitution. The issue may arise before the judiciary if marriage be prohibited unconditionally by a statute, will the Court have right to declare it void? Though hypothetical, these are the issues whose responses help for effective functioning of judicial review. Only the concern to raise such question is that the Court is, under the system of judicial review, believed to display its natural talent and judicial sympathy.<br><br>

In other aspect, fundamental right is a legally enforceable right governing the relation between the state and the individual. It has both negative and positive aspect. It does not mean merely a right of liberty possible under

444pp




the law; it also means a right of liberty in a positive sense, which enables individual to develop his personality and his faculties and to live his unity as a whole. So, all rights which are essential for human existence an instrumental in developing the individual personality are also equally essential for sustaining and developing the community and are and are fundamental and many such rights have also escaped from being incorporated in part III of the Constitution. These are the cases of Constitutional silences and the Court has to scrutinize such rights at the instances of the aggrieved persons to give relief to them by implied power of judicial review and in the growing and developing society such remedy is inevitably essential. In this regard the Constitutional interpretation is needed to bring out the hidden intention of the sovereign people<br><br>

7.7.2 Legislature<br><br>

Legislature is the most predominating phase of the public life. But the legislation to be long-lived and of practical legal effect should be in conformity with the Constitutional mandate and harmonious to the will of the people. Legislature has no legal authority to make such laws, which are repugnant to the Constitution, anti-social, destructive to the economic structure of the society, and arbitrary and against natural rights and reasons. That is why, the legislature while drafting the law should be very careful that the draft legislation is appropriate to the time and aspiration of the people. As in the words of Ehrlich, they should draft the living law not merely a law. For this, the participatory law making process is required. Along with this, Law Commission, like in other countries should be developed as a research oriented institution of law and justice. It should work as a body of drafting the law, providing consultation and recommendation in law and publicizing law decision etc.<br><br>

7.7.3 Government<br><br>

This is a bitter experience in our context that the government often treats Judiciary as an inferior part of it and the judges as its civil servants. Such

445pp





a mentality of the government is disaster in effective functioning of judicial review. The Constitution clearly outlines all to abide by the orders and decisions made in the course of hearing of a suit by Courts Implementation of Courts' decisions is of utmost crucial for the effective functioning for judicial review. In recent practices, we find a number of events where the government has disregarded the decision of Courts<br><br>

The independence of the judiciary should be guaranteed by the state in a living reality. The independence and standards of the judiciary are plainly interrelated. A judiciary, which lacks independence, lacks any acceptable standard. There are at least four essential matters, which apply to every civilized legal system, which are come into play when considering the independence of the judiciary. They lie in: the independent mechanism for the appointment of Judges; the reasonable remuneration of Judges: the security of tenure of Judges; and non interference with the work of Judges and respect for, and enforcement of their decisions.<br><br>

7.7.4 Judiciary<br><br>

The present Constitution has visioned the judiciary not only as the protector of rights but also as the protector and guardian of the Constitution. This is only an organ of the state to which a great responsibility of the nation has been imposed. For this, along with the independence, judicial competence and impartiality is needed which is possible only when there is a systematic organization of the Court, highly qualified and morale judges. It is often said that human rights remain safe in a society governed by written Constitution, so long as its judges are strong and independent and do not come into pressure or influence of certain powers. It is true that judges are not abstract and impersonal oracles, but are men whose views are necessarily, through by one conscious intent, affected by inheritance, education and environment and by the impact of history, past and present. But, this is also equally true that they cannot escape from the obligation on any circumstance that has

446pp


been imposed by the Constitution. They should always try to be sensitive to the broad social issues around them and not to come into pressure or influence of certain powers. Furthermore, they should be willing to stand impartially between the executive and the subject in matters involving the nights and civil liberties of the latter. For this, the judiciary should promote their judicial discipline and people's faith.<br><br>

Judicial discipline embarks the training of mind or moral faculties, self restraint and reformed practice of the judiciary. These principles should be assimilated if to save and preserve the judiciary in her actual sense This can be achieved when there is a good conscience of a judge and judicial self-restraint. The judicial self-restraint is indispensable in order to maintain her prestige as a consistent interpreter of the Constitutional law and the Act and action of legislature and executive branches of government respectively. Otherwise, the judiciary has to face the public indignation and reaction. Besides of this there should not be lack of experience, neutrality and stability in judicial matters. The power of contempt of Court should be exercised only in very essential circumstances and with a sincerity and good conscience.<br><br>

The Court should scrutinize the legality of legislation on the touchstone of the will of sovereign people. The society cannot run in peace and harmony if unconstitutional and immoral laws be followed to remain unchallenged. In the modern democracy where the constitutional supremacy prevails, determination of constitutionality of legislative Act is the essence of judicial review. In this connection the interpretation of law is a very important function of the Court. By interpreting the legislative law, the Court interprets the will of the legislative and by interpreting the Constitution, the Court interprets the will of the sovereign people. That is why the interpretation should never be destructive but always constructive and progressive so as to create an ideal society free from all social and political vices and tyranny.<br><br>

The study has, for the effective functioning of the system of judicial review, proposed some initiatives:<br><br>

Need of Specialization in the Court Structure: Apart from the specialization of the bench, the specialization in Court structure is urgently required. For this, a separate Constitutional Court can be set up with the jurisdiction dealing with constitutional litigations. The justification for setting up a separate Constitutional Court outside the regular Courts structure has been discussed in above paragraphs.<br><br>

Need of Plural Adjudication: In many countries of continental Europe the

belief of a single judge is not a judge has played significant role in strengthening the quality of justice. According to them, a single judge cannot render perfect justice. So, they compose the benches of three judges even at the trial level. In Nepal, even in the Supreme Court one Judge is deciding even some serious nature of cases in the preliminary hearing. Though the single judge is not given authority to deliver final verdict, its verdict on show cause notice or interim order may cause a great importance. The study therefore proposes to follow a common plural adjudication system. It could be basically useful to the constitutional litigations.<br><br>

Need to Develop Jurimetrics: The use of productive equipment and the

electronic devices and perfect desktop publication is still a dream in our country. The technology is a very helpful tool for the development and reform of legal system. The traditional method of case management, case analysis and Court practice cannot input the inevitable necessity of modern judicial administration. Therefore it is equally essential in our context to develop a new jurimetrics system in the Court practice.<br><br>

Need to Develop Public Participation: In many countries the process of direct public participation for the resolution of disputes has been Japan has developed the study group and assistant judgeship. China has recognized as inevitable content. England has developed the Jury System.

the assessor system giving the assessor as equal to the judge's authority in respective cases. Probably, we are one of the few cois introduced who have not yet adopted the role of public participation for the jad settlement of disputes. If we could do so many of issues relating to t and criminal law would be settled outside the Court and the Court would get to devote their time to the constitutional issues which generally embark the rights of the people. For this, the Apex Court or Constitutional Court to be set up outside the hierarchy of general Courts should confined with the jurisdiction of constitutional issues other than of criminal nature litigations.<br><br>

7.8 Conclusion<br><br>

The system of judicial review is predicated upon the existence of a writers Constitution that is changeable only by some extraordinary process of legislation or referendum. The availability of judicial review is the necessary condition, psychologically if not logically, of a system of administrative power which purports to be legitimate, or legally valid

A Constitution is called the basic law, the fundamental law, the organic law, the supreme law or the paramount law. Whichever phrase is used, a conveys the same idea that the Constitution is a prime document to deal with the state activities. A written Constitution necessarily implies a limited government. And judicial review is a necessary commitment of a limited government.985<br><br>

In order to secure social, economic and political justice or to ensure liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship or to establish equality of status and opportunity to all its citizens, it is essential that limitatima should be prescribed upon the agencies of government so as to pract basic liberties against excessive social control or legislative and executive

despotism and also to secure justice and equality. In this connection some authority must be given the power to uphold the Constitution and principles enshrined therein and to enforce them effectively so as to secure compliance with them and punishments for their violation. The agency under the Constitution which has been vested with the power and authority to uphold and enforce the Constitution is predominantly the Court and its power of judicial review.<br><br>

There are, of course, many different devices for protecting the provisions of a Constitution from the operation of the legislature and executive Out of them, the most reliable device may of the system of judicial review though which the judiciary in a democratic country scrutinize the basic legality of government actions and declare them null and void in case they are proved having been conflict with the Constitutional provisions<br><br>

It is the duty of judiciary to ensure that all the laws are in conformity with the provisions of the Constitution. The power to scrutinize laws and executive actions and to test their conformity with the Constitution and to strike them down, if they are found to be inconsistent with it, is generally described as the power of judicial review. For the effective use of this power, the judiciary must be independent, impartial and competent, It would not be otherwise to state that the system of judicial review requires the judiciary with these stated basic characteristics<br><br>

It is believed that the American world was started when the decision was delivered by the Chief Justice Marshall and that made him immortal. The judgment in this case is one of the great land-marks in the history of American Constitutional Law and is of supreme authority in respect of the power and duty of the Supreme Court to determine the validity of Acts of Congress enacted in violation of the limitations of the Constitution. The most significant fact is that although the Constitution of US never provided expressly for judicial review, yet the great judgment of Marshall in this case established that the Supreme Court had power and that it wa

its duty to declare a statute void if it was repugnant to the Conti Provided the controversy in this case was that the Court came to the conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to issue writ of mandamus Marshal held that the Judiciary Act of 1789 purporting to add to the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court the power to issue such awit exceeded the authority of the Congress under the Constitution. Therefore he announced that it was the duty of the Court to declare this section vad

It is significant that after 1803 when the Marbury judgment was pronounced, the next case in which an Act of the Congress was declared invalid by the Supreme Court was the famous Dred Scott Case in 1857 Possibly the history of Constitutional development of the United States I would have been different if the power of judicial review had not been pronounced and exercised and the doctrine clearly established in that case 986 These historical instances prove that the system of judicial review today has been an integral part of every new democracy, rule of law and constitutionalism. In this point now the hypothesis of the study there can be no Constitution without fundamental rights, no fundamental rights without judicial review, and none of them with out competent, impartial and independent judiciary" has been justified.<br><br>

Under the system of judicial review, functions of the judiciary do not merely limit within to make decisions that others should make, but it is here to preserve morale, to develop competence, to fix responsibility, and to preserve authority. The institution of judicial review may be imperied as much by its excessive exercise as by its virtual non-exercise, and the important thing is to maintain the correct balance However, the system itself is an inanimate thing. Its provision in the Constitution is merely a dead unless and until it is translated into a real practice.<br><br>

There is no denying the fact that judicial review ultimately responses so the evils committed against constitutional democracy by the legislative as well as executive branches of the government, and as such judicial review serves as an omnipresent and potential omnipotent check on legislativ lawlessness as well as executive lawlessness<br><br>

Hamilton in the Federalist Papers, no. 78, (1788) writes that the complete independence of the Courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution, he understood one which intens certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority, such, for instan as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex-post-facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of Courts of justice, whose duty it must b declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution d Without this, all the reservations of particular rights of privileges would amount to nothing.<br><br>

Some perplexity respecting the rights of the Courts to pronounce legislative acts void, because contrary to the Constitution, has arisen from an imagination that the doctrine would imply a superiority of the judiciary to the legislative power. It is argued that the authority which can declare the acts of another void must necessarily be superior to the one whose acts may be declared void... The interpretation of the laws is the proper and peculiar province of the Courts. A Constitution is, in fact, and must be regarded by the judges, as a fundamental law It therefore belongs to them to ascertain its meaning, as well as the meaning of any particular act proceeding from the legislative body. If there should happen to be an irreconcilable variance between the two that, which has the superior obligation and validity ought, of course, to be preferred; or, in other words, the Constitution ought to be preferred to the statute, the intention of the people to the intention of their agents...<br><br>

It can be no weight to say that the Courts, on the pretence of w repugnancy, may substitute their own pleasure to the Constitutional intentions of the legislature. This might as well happen in the case of two contradictory statutes; or it might as well happen in every adjudication upon any single statute. The Courts must declare the sense of the law, and if they should be disposed to exercise will instead of judgment, the consequence would equally be the substitution of their pleasure to that of the legislative body. The observation, if it proves anything, would prove that there ought to be no judges distinct from that body...<br><br>

Our founding fathers of the Constitution seem to have adopted a balanced Constitution, a Constitution in which liberty and property are guaranteed by law, in which there are separate legislative, executive and judicial powers.<br><br>

Granting that a Constitution must be supreme over contrary law, why are the Courts the final body to decide when a law is in fact contrary to the Constitution? It is true that the judges take an oath to support the Constitution, but all legislators, executive and judicial officers of the state are similarly bound by oath. Then how can one branch of government (state), the judiciary, be supreme over a coordinate branch?<br><br>

Some laws which were passed by the first parliament have also been declared ultra vires the Constitution. The parliament where a few of whose members had taken part in framing the Constitution. Now, how likely is it that the framers of the Constitution would enact, some years later, a statute contrary to the Constitution?<br><br>

Can democracy exist when the Courts are not the final arbiters? In England, parliament can change judicial decisions by statute. The French have clung tenaciously to the idea that no judicial organ should be given the power to review statutes for conformity with a higher law. Until

Can democracy exist when the Courts are final arbiters Marshalles that his government is a government of laws, and not of men. But judges are just as human as legislators. Is our government gemmes of judges? Charles Evans Hughes remarked in 1907: we are under Constitution, but the Constitution is what the judges say it is

Is there a danger that the institution of judicial review will encourage the

other branches of government to abdicate their responsibility to follow the

Constitution?<br><br>

One confusion still remains in the exercise of judicial review power. That a-does that mean that the Court should only invalidate legislation clearly in conflict with the Constitution? And should (must) the Court, in cases of doubt, defer to the legislative judgment?<br><br>

An applicant for judicial review must have a sufficient interest in

questioning the decision which is sought to review.<br><br>

When individual interests are in stake judicial review is an invariable requirement. The Constitutional Courts are the acknowledged architects and guarantors of the integrity of the legal system. The very intentan the system of judicial review is to bring each agency into harmony with the totality of the law, the law as it is found in the statute at hand, the statute book at large, the principles and conceptions of the common law, and the ultimate guarantees associated with the Constitution<br><br>

Court's Power: a power of judgment and scrutinize the conformity of statute with the Constitution: Mr. Justice Roberts in the case of UB Butler observed: when an Act of Congress is appropriately challenged in the Courts as not conforming to the constitutional mandate the judicial branch of the government has only one duty to lay the article of the Constitution which is invoked beside the statute which is challenged and to decide whether the latter squares with the former. All the Court does, or on do is to announce its considered judgment upon the question. The only power it has, if such it may be called, is the power of judgment. This Court neither approves nor condemns any legislative policy. Its delicate and difficult office is to ascertain and declare whether the legislation is in accordance with, or in contravention of, the provisions of the Constution and having done that, its duty ends.<br><br>

Professors Hyman and Nathanson, who represented the Office of Price Control (OPA) before the Emergency Court of Appeals, have paid a remarkable tribute to the value of judicial review... it would be a mistake to think of judicial review of price control solely in negative terms not so much what the Court did, but the fact that it was there as a place of last resort, where the administrator's actions might eventually be subjected to dispassionate analysis, that had a healthy effect upon all the diverse elements involved in the administration of price controlar<br><br>

In a rule of law, no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of an individual except on the condition that he can support the legality of his action before a Court of law justice. The Constitution of Nepal has incorporated this principle in three specific provisions which say that (a) no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except in accordance with law; (b) no tax shall be levied or collected except by the authority of law; and (c) no person shall be deprived of his property<br><br>

by the authority of law. And, these basic principles of the Constitution can be maintained and upheld by the systems of j

The judiciary checks the executive and legislature by being available to review their actions, to decide whether they are lawful or not. The jurisdiction extends over the executive in its widest sense, including local authorities, public corporations, the police, and other bodies eng public functions. Normally, the issue arises through use of an application for judicial review in the Supreme Court, which in its supervisory jurisdiction may hold that any of these persons or bodies has acted unlawfully, on grounds of illegality, procedural impropriety irrationality of

As was noticed earlier, the Courts capacity to review the exercise of public power is not confined to uses of statutory powers but extés prerogative and non-statutory power as well.<br><br>

During this later period of Nepal shifted from a Constitution of implied power under the express power to a Constitution of implied limitations upon the express powers. It was virtually the same writing a new and infinitely narrower Constitution.<br><br>

The Supreme Court could be a weapon of social and economic reforma palladium of liberty, as readily as a refuge for industrial and financial malefactors. In this juncture, the SC has to interpret the implied powers of parliament instead of cutting down its express power. For example, the Constitution confers the power to tax on parliament. It nowhere gives it an

express power to spend money, it is now the duty of a Court to interpret that the right to tax implies the power to spend.

The main problem in the system is the timeliness of judicial review. Long time consumed in settlement of dispute may mean violation of liberty. inordinate delay results in unpleasantness to the litigants as well as the system.<br><br>

The dilemma may be worked out by a methodological study of judge su decision ratio in such a way that the ratio in carried forward automatically with the increase in population as well as suit-population Workload and manpower have to be worked out scientifically by the statisticians in order to estimate or ameliorate the riddle of delay as well as jettison the problem of irreparable situations caused by numbers and delays which otherwise seem to be counter-productive to effective judicial review<br><br>

Our judicial system is based on west-minister model. Our concept of rule of law is the concept of common law. In our system all laws enacted by legislature can be questioned before the Court of law. So, the process of judicial review in accordance with the system is democratic. It is not an democratic Unlike in England, we have written Constitution and independent judiciary with the power of judicial review. Our acceptance is Constitutional supremacy and parliamentary system but not of parliamentary supremacy: Our judiciary is a guardian and final interpreter of the law.<br><br>

To conclude, the researcher would observe that judicial review makes the Constitution legalistic, a commitment to the rule of law as the best protection against tyranny. It upholds the rule of law Under the system of judicial review it is believed that judicial thought is there for catching up with the nation's thought.<br><br>
